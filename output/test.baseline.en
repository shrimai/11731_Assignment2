when steve lopez , funny the los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of los angeles -- i went to hear it 's a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , how likable , somewhere , homeless , the on a violin , was going to the only two strings , i had .
many of you 're going to the story that you know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that includes a movie was , by robert downey junior varsity when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the most <unk> school , and its very promising career tragically the early by your paranoid schizophrenia , was ended .
nathaniel resigned from juilliard school , i went into a <unk> and 30 years later on dry it as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or your watch a movie , so they 're not just the wonderful connected to understand the between those two men 's happened is , but also , like the music , this is linked to make some help , and how they finally , this instrument came , if this pun , allowing sperm is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i met this mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of a snippet first , and fourth symphony of yours and got behind the stage , around me to imagine .
he talked in a very <unk> and social sound of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers , it 's not in the baseball world series of creating would . and this all over that <unk> characters in the first violin at the last sentence by a snippet fourth symphony .
so we 're getting to talk about music to speak . and a few days later i received an email , in the state that nathaniel to <unk> at my interest .
i need to just say that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he had been doing a great shocks and with <unk> and the courthouse been treated , a trauma , that his whole life was tracked down .
a number of it is now , especially vulnerable to the schizophrenics stages . they 're sometimes that bad , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , and that the horror and the <unk> of his own mind 's exposed .
and in precisely such a <unk> was under nathaniel , when we do with our first to class in the walt disney <unk> hall were beginning . he had this wrong about the flickering in his eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and about how it 's somebody in my sleep and poison and i wanted .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid that i 'll lose could that it in a day one stages , sinking could , and that i had its relationship to a violin at the could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and other interesting pieces of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
and i got so easy to play .
i played the first sentence by a snippet <unk> .
and while i was going to hit me on that in <unk> eyes a full of change was happening .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible to deliver it said , a chemical response , at the catalyst of my game was .
<unk> <unk> , although they turned into understanding , in a steady of curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you up to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we began to go back , about music to speak , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> down to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear that he does n't just <unk> know about music i owned , but it with you also a tight personal relationship you connected .
he talked about her with a passion and a sense , that i 'll just by my colleagues in philharmonic , from los angeles to know .
by his music playing and about music , talking , was one of <unk> , confused a man , the same thing around the streets of los angeles moved there was , a particularly adorable , <unk> , <unk> , in the juilliard oxford-trained musician .
music is medicine . music is transforming ourselves .
for nathaniel means that music involves health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions . through his imagination and creativity in a real to transform .
and so <unk> his agonized situation .
i realized that in this : the essence of art is .
in this is the reason that we music to do : so we do something that in all of us , deep inside of , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality tv formats .
and the fact that expression of reaching us all , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel undertook , so i took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family of musicians , the it 's mind that might be a talent and i went and he waited for .
and i 'm going to keep using nathaniel music , whether it in the walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me of it , why i musicians , i made me .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i 'd rather play , that i <unk> the blindfolded , stolen .
i hope that they excuse me .
so i have in my life , many fishes were known .
i 've only two very popular .
this first , this was more like a passionate affair with .
it was a flying fish , <unk> good , consistency , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the charges in the top of standards of sustainability is raised .
you could be so i feel about that , it to sell it .
i had its beauty of a sense for several months .
one day , called the head of the company in and she said , if i 'm at an event , i memorized it might think about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
there was a company , the to solve was trying to what this incredible this problem for chefs , has become . how to keep that we fish on our menus put it ?
in the last 50 years , we have the sea fish like we forests <unk> done all have .
it 's hard , the destruction of accuracy .
ninety percent of the big fish , the ones that we love , these tuna , the <unk> , the all-terrain , this swordfish , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so i will probably disney or bad <unk> , <unk> , a piece of our future .
many of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
i mean , 15 pounds supports these are necessary , so you a little three-pound <unk> get .
so not sustainable .
theyâ€™re not very good .
so here was finally one company , who was trying to be able to do .
i wanted to support .
day before the event , i called the head of the public relations to the company in .
we call him , don .
, don '' which i said , `` just about the aggregate them to have , you are famous for , so far out in the oceans , to grow that you the environment is not being polluted water . ''
`` this is true , '' he said . `` we 're so far out that the garbage by your fish that distributes news is , not paying attention . ''
and then he included in addition , `` we 're essentially a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what feeding her ? ''
well , to sustain and proteins , '' he said .
`` great '' which i said . put on .
and at that night , i was in bed , i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein that ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don on .
i said , don , what for example of the kids sustain and proteins that ? ''
he said , he figured out that 's not . he 'll ask folks .

we call him as well , don .
, don '' which i said , `` what for example of the kids sustain and proteins that ? ''
well , he said , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers to the skin , <unk> , remnants of <unk> and to get food processing . ''
i said , `` how much of the corners , consume it 's chicken ? well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don which is deeply about , chicken at the fish to feed ? ''
there was a break in the leadership , and he said , `` there 's just too chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me about this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i 've <unk> actually coming from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish through this entertainment , for chicken , tasted star has .

it 's the romantic sort of the way , where you , ever better if you put his fish about learning , you the fish in the more love .
i 've got to begin with a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist that had been thinking about this fish .
think that has a sense reverse-engineering this .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing in the white color .
the chef who did <unk> .
it means is twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste , me , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can it .
we call it is miguel . actually means he is miguel .
and no , he has the fish no , cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the kind of them and i include the idea .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it 's near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
and up in the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on which basically the wetlands have been .
they took this , by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated series of media channels , and they kept on water coming from land out and that into the river .
now , they could n't change that was fine , not economic .
and ecologically and it was a catastrophe .
it was roughly 90 percent of birds in which for this place , many birds are .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company with green bought that land .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of water around .
they 've literally the lever , thrown away .
instead of the water <unk> they tried to the channels to the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created an eleven thousand of acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel that -- and you have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction all through reverse .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something like never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , the one million miles away is , and everything you see are <unk> channels and that population density , lush march .
i was there was n't long time with miguel .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of `` a crocodile , kissing .

here , picks it 's a rare <unk> out .
now beginning of the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here , which he 's a pattern of split , that it on the tanzanian giraffe , to mind .
it turns out that is miguel most of his career in <unk> park in africa has spent .
i asked him , like him to such a <unk> 's become .
he said to fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm an expert , for connection . ''
and then he leaves , and fall into more talking about those rare in the birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and understand how do n't like me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was sick of this <unk> piece of delicious this fish , that i was in the brink had .
so i put him , broken . i said , `` miguel , how does that your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , he goes to tell me that it 's such an enormously system is that the fishes better food , what you in the wilderness -- would .
the vegetable biomass of phytoplankton , the <unk> , this is it , what the fish to baseball .
this system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there is not get food .
i 've heard of a farm in is , the way of animals not a baseball ?
later , the day i drove up this site of which is miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , the way of course it seems to be , '' different from each ant farm , on the i ever been , `` how it pertains to succeed ? ''
in the moment , it was like a filmmaker a <unk> requires that would have .
and we bent around the corner and we offered at the incredible picture , thousands and thousands , pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet and so far from the eye can see .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look through their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely overwhelmed .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
now , last year we were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 100 different types .
it 's now the largest and one of the key to private <unk> across europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> n't last thing that is on a <unk> have to ? ''
he kept shaking his head , no .
he said , how we build <unk> on , not heavily .
this is a to replace the network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
each , pinker 's so the belly of the better , the system . ''
okay , let 's the issues . a farm , the way of animals not a baseball , and a farm , the their success on the health of its predators on measuring .
a <unk> , but a little <unk> .
oh , and the way of these flamingos covered by the first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city are 240 million miles away , where the <unk> 's better for the <unk> .
every morning to fly up 240 million miles to farm .
and every night will go up 240 million miles away .
they 're doing that , because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had to me a journey of penguins are introduced , so i looked miguel on .
i said , `` miguel , fly up 240 million miles to the farm and fly them up 240 million miles back on the evening ?
do it for the children ? ''
he looked at me , like i just a song from the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they 're doing that , because the food is better . ''
i did n't the skin of my beloved of a fish mentioned , most delicious , and i do n't like <unk> . i like this is not <unk> . i like this is not crunchy food .
it 's this scathing about , <unk> flavor .
i cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i do in this restaurant in <unk> till i 've got you do n't go <unk> tasted star .
she liked it 's sweet and change course , as if you a half bites by the ocean as your dignity .
i mentioned the opposite is miguel , and he take naps every time .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a sponge .
it is the last defenses , until something in the body to entry .
it has evolved over the evolution has evolved to <unk> suck up . ''
and then he included in addition , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , the your fish do n't a baseball . a farm , the their success then measure the success of its predators .
and then i 'm sure , if he says , a farm , the no <unk> has , <unk> he 's powerful , because the water , this is through this farm that flows from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , of all the things around the more of which are rivers of these days later on a propensity , if you want to lead , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it goes through the system , fought in and this leaves is the waters clean , as well <unk> is .
this system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the way of animals not a baseball , not just a farm , the their success on the health of its predators , measures , but a farm , who literally a <unk> is , and not only for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .

you might argue that it 's a recipe is the future of good food , if we of <unk> or <unk> speak .
what we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , ' delicious .
but for many people that 's a little bit more radical .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we are unclear ] .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat the organic .
and if they claim that the things are , the future of good food was a person represents somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how you will feed the world ?
how you will feed the world ? ''
i must be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we have many calories , and produce the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are going to starve .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- because <unk> disparities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years of the up .
i 'm feeding the grain of <unk> , <unk> at monocultures , chemicals in the earth , chicken at the fish , and all the time has to agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people 's cheaper to feed , how awful it can really be ? ''
this was the motivation . it was the place . it was the plan , the american agriculture .
we should they call , what it is , a little crafts and in <unk> , a viral , this quickly to replace the day as eating away , the fact , the production of itself .
this is not a viral , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> is today face , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through a fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not a chainsaw , but through the forests , and not across boats , and networks , but through the fish in the oceans .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how we going to feed ?
or better , how do we might be able to each community , enabling to herself to feed ?
in order to do this , donâ€™t look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are doing <unk> and it has never really good for food produced .
let me behind the green model for .
this is that are two billion years of their eagerness to profanities .
look miguel , at the farmers how is miguel ,
businesses that do n't worlds of themselves are , businesses that restore levels of <unk> , factories , the <unk> growing some rather than just hard to farmers who are not only emitters of , but experts , for connection ,
because they are ones who also experts to flavor .
and if i really honestly , they 're a better , chef : when i it ever be going .
so you know that 's my right , because if that the future of good food is , it 's delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today , one thing to convince you want it is that the totality of data that we consume that 's bigger than the sum of the parts and instead of at <unk> to think i want to think about how we information that can use that 's a different patterns are unique and we so they 're actually see , who otherwise never seen that got together .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after the age , arranged .
this program that i 'm running here , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do this is that i after a certain death will filter , let 's an accident .
and immediately , i see a different patterns , this is zero .
and now , because in <unk> here , people on the active are and you over here at <unk> are .
we can one more step out and reorganize the data , then again and see that <unk> and cancer in the usual suspects have , but not for everyone .
so if we go further and after the age , sort , put 40 years or a younger , we see that are accidents , even the main cause is about the people care about .
and who <unk> see that 's this particular , men in their true .
you see so that view of information and data , this way of swimming in a living <unk> to mind .
and if we do this for raw data can make , why not true for the content matters ?
what we now here are the front covers , every single , sport <unk> '' which has ever in print .
it 's all right here . it 's everything online .
they could be happy , after my talk , in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can be related to a certain issue forward .
now if i 'm looking , i see the athletes who in this issue some rash appear and most striking .
i 'm a lance armstrong 's a fan , so i click happened upon himself to me all expenses that point where lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> overview of like , i could think , `` ok , what if i 'm all with the subject , biking , you look ? ''
so i walk a step back <unk> the standpoint .
now , i see , greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that what if you that way information , digs around , specifically , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , then it looks for you do n't , exchanging not just .
you do something that actually a bit different is .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way , and the way information can be used .
i 'd like this idea now a little more tasks being about what a bit is .
so here we 've done is , we have every single <unk> taken and you on a little summary , reduced .
the summary , containing a short , often , and a symbol of the area from it .
i just going to look at the top five the most popular <unk> .
but even in this , in unconstrained view , we can a lot of things do .
now , we have a sense of the issues , the on wikipedia , most popular ones .
i 'm going to the issue <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' elected to have you know what i will <unk> who most powerful it needs time about transcending the people of the year , '' are .
this is really important , because this is an insight is that 's not in a single <unk> shape .
this is just to see if you one step back and it looks .
overlooking a certain that <unk> i can go into the topic that time about transcending the people of the year , '' in : go , and all together to see .
if i all these people consider you know what i that the majority of <unk> are . some people come out of science . some , less again , come from the economy . here 's my head . and one is coming from <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now fast forward and a look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we are browsing the web of the first time as if it also really a net is , not just by side to , but more abstractly .
and so i want something else to show what a little surprise that might help .
i 'll show here just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want it 's not a browser , call it ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites getting this reputation -- and we bring these <unk> to each blog how this .
so i can one step back to , and directly to a particular unit of jumping .
this is so important because you just by that look at websites are in this kind of the way , all the <unk> on the same type and it 's look at that .
so i can in my trajectory zoom in a certain horizon .
here is the state of all the demonstration , the i 'm going to go 've given .
and i can say anything , what i 'm going to look up , back to bring .
and when i 'm going back one step <unk> and all night , i can think that exact same way to mandate , maybe for my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' was researching , here to this person. , right here to live from labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the left foot and again , they bring up .
it 's a metaphor , who kept being used , and every time it makes it looks like , bigger than the sum of the pieces .
now , in this world , we think that data a curse those are .
we 're talking about , cursing the <unk> .
we 're talking about , drowning in information .
what if we this situation to turn up and the internet on its head to ask , so that we 're rather than anything from going to others to go to start by many things too many things go to do , and this pattern recognition , what otherwise , hidden behind them all right ?
if we do that can , then that 's going <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source of urgency of information .
and , rather be just in information to move , we can learn from over time .
and if we know that experience , then we can maybe even the wisdom into account .
so i hear on , thanks .
i grew up with one <unk> portion of science fiction to .
in my school got off with the bus to school , every day an hour 's a distance .
and my nose , after it always a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way my feet in me posture , voracious , curiosity satisfied .
this exploration and it turns out to be doing that i always , when i 'm not in school was , through the forests <unk> , walking and `` the samples . '' i started collecting , frogs and snakes and bugs , and <unk> , all of bringing it home and under the microscope looked at this .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was when they 've always around the trial , the world to understand and the limits of sorts of explore .
and my love to science fiction made up in my next picture , but then , in the late '60s , they went to the moon and tunnels inside the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our room with his sample . shows that we animals and places and a world of wonders they showed that we never would we can imagine .
that 's probably will pretty good at <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video yet these <unk> with computer-generated movies , we 're all the brush in the landscape was , i had to the images in my head to create .
that we had time , all . if we as children 's a book were checking , we entered the description of the author and projected to look at the screen in our minds .
my response to it was that sketching and paint by aliens , alien world , robots , the spacecrafts , and all kind of stuff .
in class i would get away from teachers get it , like me , below the textbook was hidden , <unk> .
the creative person must happen to get out .
and when they 've done something interesting . what i 'm going to jacques <unk> shows that fascinated was the idea of some of us to be completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i did n't be an alien world with a spacecraft to achieve . this seemed to me very unlikely .
but there was a world which i actually enter her back , here on earth , and she was also fascinating and exotic as all this , what i 'm always imagined was , when i these books or read them .
so i decided , when i was 15 , scuba divers can become .
the only problem that was that i 'm going to a small village in canada , living , 1,000 kilometers from the oceans getting away .
these and i let me , but not to discourage .
i 've been bugging my father , until he had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , folks who did , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter , in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i received only two years later to face , when we to california , spinning .
since , in the 40 years , the now , apology and are , i 've got about 3,000 hours in water spent . 300 hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world , the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich with <unk> life is , how we do it 's really hardly anyone can imagine .
the imagination , the nature does n't know , borders , quite as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to present day i feel that i just utter awe of this , what i have on my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean 's holding up with the same intensity as jesus , and ever .
when i 'll be an adult encountering a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
this seemed the best , my inner drive , stories to tell , with my desire , images to create , to unite .
when he drew me off a comic books and so .
so these films , the way , images and stories of string . that fit together .
now , we were the stories that i 'm <unk> , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> .
with `` <unk> '' i became my preference for the <unk> and that dip to the <unk> together .
so intertwined when they kind of my two passions .
something interesting happened with `` <unk> '' : for a <unk> problem in this video to solve -- and while we had some sort of liquid <unk> create -- which is cracked , we 're going on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what we published , was the first computer-generated <unk> , the time in a film to see it was .
the film did that 's no money one , just said , was he just in his caused by a , but i noticed an amazing thing : the audience around the world was like it was mesmerized by the magic , the of forcing .
according to arthur clarke 's law of course , are <unk> technology and magic is no longer have evolved to tell .
they were doing something magic .
and that i thought was terribly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , that have to be in the cinematic be involved . ''
so we go into the terminator , two , '' my next movie , even more on .
together with <unk> created we have the types of liquid metal . the success was clinging to the way from , like this effect basic dignity .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same . '' now we did with the movie is a bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences , assuming that was a whole world -- there , a whole world of creativity to <unk> .
so i founded a company , combined with my good friend with stan winston to the era over the best <unk> and <unk> was . they called `` the digital <unk> .
the core of this company was it , the stage <unk> processes with visual printers etc . to skip over the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we did n't go back again , and lead us such a while a competitive .
but the middle of the '90s , we realized it 's what that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , yes , basically founded was -- too slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` the avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects in the whole new heights , we say it should , with lifelike human , expressive characters , the actual <unk> surgeons had it . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world ought <unk> be .
but the <unk> put stuff back . and people in my company , said , that we <unk> not in a position and know , that to create .
so , shifted that , i doing this other film on the big ship , that goes down .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> <unk> emerged , a passionate about .
secretly , but i wanted to actually to leverage to cover the titanic to immerse ourselves .
why i put the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that is not .
i have it 's convinced , by i said , how we try to the wreckage . we shoot the real wreckage .
we will be in the <unk> of the show you .

and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that 's coming back to it will own imagination a reality rendering it can .
we then created in fact , six months after a reality , where i 'm going to a russian <unk> workshop , four kilometers in the surface of the atlantic , and i from the real titanic , through a <unk> aha ! .
this is no movie , not a high definition , which was really .
so , now i was really gets blown away .
and the preparedness that were enormous . we had camera and the light , and all kinds of building .
and i fell on , how much of these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
it gets into that cramped capsule , then it 's floating , you in this dark , hostile environment just down , where no hope to saving is , if you do n't even back .
and i said , `` wow , that 's just as well , as if i 'm going to a science-fiction movie .
this is really cool . ''
i was literally owned by studying the deep .
anyway by the part of the with curiosity and science got to do . it was it . it was exploring , it was a curiosity . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i from hollywood 's not be able to .
because , you know , i was able to me a creature , imagine , for that we get a visual effects of designing their use . but i could n't tell me that to imagine what i was outside of the window would see .
in on the following characteristics of expeditions i have creatures in <unk> seen , and sometimes the things that i never seen before i had , even sometimes the things that even though nobody ever seen earlier had and for the science starting point , when we do you saw , even know no words that had found .
now i was so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i met , then one thing that particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i told me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood to ice , ok , and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we began to the bismarck '' , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we returned to cover the titanic .
we took a little robot that we built up , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> up and it inside of the ship to watch , what they 've ever done had been .
nobody had ever it inside of <unk> explored . you did n't cure for . so we have developed to build a technology .
well , and for me sit well , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , this sort of <unk> here 's quite similar , and from which i know that once the band , performed there 's .
and i was flying through a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i serve it 's just really , but my mind is inside the edge .
it felt at , as if i physical spaces inside of <unk> the titanic and exploration .
this was the most surreal of sort of <unk> that i ever have experienced . because before i caught by a corner , i took a , i knew i always , what a moment in <unk> of the vehicle , show you 'd given that i months and over the <unk> been running , when we the film was constantly .
this is set was an exact replica of design plans of the ship .
so that was a very strange and experience .
they made me that <unk> realized that you have such <unk> avatars and use and so that your mind of the car , in these different shape of existence and human rights can .
it was really quite profound
and maybe even a brief reference to that which may be a few decades , can happen , if you <unk> has to make things to explore , or other things to do , in all sorts <unk> <unk> that i was <unk> could imagine .
after these expeditions we started this , what we down there 'd seen , really appreciate to learn to take these <unk> , where we are incredibly fast track animals were kind of the 're like aliens , but here for .
they live with chemosynthesis .
they are not in a on energy as raw material system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the next one of 300 degrees centigrade , we call that they survive there .
the same time interest , i 'm also very much for <unk> , that was the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up at the people who became for the space , study and with the nasa 's having to do and in <unk> sit and the right <unk> plan . they go to russia , through from the mission of the biomedical protocol , along with all its bells and whistles to fly off to international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but the end , it was looking beyond that i <unk> with us in the deep into thinking .
i pulled them with and <unk> you access to the world 's down there , <unk> , <unk> , people who became for such extreme conditions , interesting . i pulled them to the vents at , so you look around , some samples to take and instruments , test was , and so forth .
we turned his documentary films , you pick up actually , and science , specifically , <unk> .
so has joined the circle anywhere between my existence as <unk> , then as a kid , and the execution in the reality .
throughout all these -- irreversibly , i have a lot of them .
i have a lot of science . but i 'm thinking , you probably , a director to be able to guide , a leader be like a <unk> or something .
i realized , but not a lot of leadership , before i do this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because at some point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do this ? what comes out ? ''
these stinking movies are taking us no money .
we play time in the manufacturing costs a . of fame -- not a lane .
all think , i was between the `` titanic '' and the avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd let me out of nails -- on one towel from the beach , tweaked her .
i 've all these films , the documentaries no , for a very small audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what you doing that ?
you 're doing it around the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the most challenging and environment that there . you 're doing it 's <unk> because , and because of funny connection , the structure , if a small group of people a team up forming .
because we have all this with only 10 or 12 people made , the years , non-stop , have partnered with . sometimes we were two or three months row , at sea .
and in this community you realize that most important thing to be aware is that you with each has , because you a job to overcome . does that you nobody else can explain .
if you on land <unk> and they say , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and this very vague , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human capability , if you look at sea , work , '' then you can see something else does n't explain . that 's like with police officer or at wounded soldier who do something together they 've gone , and you know that they never find somebody can explain .
there is a connection , a each other respect .
when i go back to my next movie `` the avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same attends to apply this thing , that you his team have respected and up in return of respect , deserves .
it was the dynamic really changed .
because i stood so again with a small team up with unknown terrain . we turned the avatar . '' with a new technique that it before we did n't .
immensely exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we went to a period of a half years to a real family .
so broken up my kind of films to do , completely .
there were people who said , we have these <unk> did n't really good <unk> and the planet pandora 's used to go .
for me , it was more a <unk> kind of my job to do , the actual process , the way in conclusion that changed .
what we can go from all of my point ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think about the first job is the curiosity .
it 's most powerful of human quality .
our imagination is a force , the fact , a reality rendering it can .
and the be aware of your team is important than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , the `` give me one of advice , as i thought that can do . ''
and i say `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that they put on others for you . do n't tell ourselves to bet you 're not for themselves . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been a <unk> `` failure is no option . ''
but in the art and on the study has to fail as an alternative to be , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no big endeavor , this innovation called , was ever done without risk being addressed .
you must be willing to these risks on up to take .
that 's the idea that i 'm going to talk on the way to give you want . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
now i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised that maybe something , because at my <unk> at the foundation , mostly around the vaccines , and seed is to the things that we self-invent , and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life to happen .
but energy and climate is incredibly important for those people , in fact , even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> which means , whose <unk> over many years , not will grow . it 's too much or to do n't rain . the things will go to change how it their fragile environment is not could bear .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for you 're going .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
in fact that , if you just one thing the price down so we could , to <unk> would be nothing close to the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .

we are so in an incredible situation with electricity in the wealthy world .
but if we get the price down -- let 's the price to half -- we 're hitting on a new green belt , and this barrier that 's connected to co2 .
co2 , warmed the planet and the equation for carbon dioxide 's actually very clear .

now , the exact same relationship between a <unk> and the warm up the net <unk> and where those other outcomes are , there 's some of them grapple , but not a lot .
and there are certainly obscurity , about how much these effects . but they are deeply unhappy being .
i have the <unk> multiple people ask , `` we 've got down near zero to come ?
do better than half the or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we are near zero to come to the temperature up into space .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have 3.5 feet high office truck , the top of 10 feet bridge over there must . the you can then sort of fellow from left , they .
this has totally down , at zero .

guess what about 20 tons of people from developing countries , less than one .
on average , it 's about 10 tons for each of the planet .
and somehow we need to change , fulfilling this , the thing to zero to lower .
it 's been the same time .
all kinds of economic transformations are it actually modified and we need of <unk> rise to reducing go to a gas to zero .
that equation , has four factors . a little multiplication problem . they have this thing left -- and co2 -- that you 're moving towards zero want to bring and this is used by the number of people depend on , of the service , the average person on average use , the average of energy for any service and the co2 , that per unit <unk> will .
let 's so every single factor of transistors used to see , and i think we , how we 're going to zero to get .
probably has to those numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but let 's time .
first , we the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it goes to 9 billion to . who are at 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i think about 10 percent or 15 percent down , but now we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second thing is the services that we use .
that includes all , the food that we eat , clothing , television , plumbing .
this is very good things and <unk> mean , those services are virtually everyone on the planet have access to do .
it 's amazing that number drops .
in the wealthy world , in the first 200 billion , could we would stain me make and less energy efficient , but on average is that number , every year to grow up and so collectively than double , the number of market in the per person to be provided .
there 's a very basic services . there 's home with the light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so what they go out and see your schoolwork under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there are finally , good-news stories .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , with other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , whose <unk> some of those services to make up by 90 percent reduction happening .
in any service , like the cultivation of <unk> which is 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the scope for improvement , very much smaller .
and large , if we feel optimistic is , we have this may be reduced by a factor of three or maybe take a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion in may <unk> 13 billion tons of the rest . and that comes n't come out !
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a x-factor be -- this is the amount of co2 , the per unit <unk> will .
it comes up the question , if you 're going to zero to get more .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables , and <unk> .
so , what we 're going on a global level to create , is , a new system to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` hey , '' i use , i 'm not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people have to the development of a lot of this miracle that contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain date , it needs .
usually if you can kind of footholds , and if you have come , wo n't .
in this case , we need , but you floor , and give a miracle in very long time .
now , i wondered , how can i do this <unk> ?

i think back at last year , when i mosquitos to stop and somehow i liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know , there are people there , the by mosquitos to live .
for energy , i noticed this one .
i decided that <unk> with fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment where would be .
so here are some natural or fireflies .
you have to me that insured that they do n't bite . actually going to do n't think that time that glass , left .
now , there are all sorts <unk> like this , but they bring everybody 's not much .
we need technological solutions , either one or a couple of an incredible this scale and how incredible dependability . and although it many ways that there , for people look for someone , i really just five , of these large the needs can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels leave out .
this is capable of may consider the moderates contributions and if you better job as i expect to be the great , but my the core here is that we take all those who have to work , and we can not one of you give up , because they will be scary , because all have significant problems .
let 's first of the burning fossil fuels along , burning of either of coal or gas .
what you have to do n't need to which seems to be easy , but it does n't . you could have all the co2 , it off burn off a funnel , comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then there is stored and hope that there 's left .
there are some of pilot , the thing on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to be very difficult . and an agreement for the storage out of co2 to outcomes , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will be sure ?
who can do assure in which literally hours a billion times bigger than any kind of waste , the makes one of <unk> and other things we can imagine what ?
this is a lot of volume .

when the next thing : <unk> .
who has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question of security , that you really feel that nothing wrong can walk , despite the human participation , that the fuel not for their weapon being used .
and what do you go with junk that ?
because despite all he 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three really heavy problems that may be solvable are , and there where you went to work better .
the last three of the five , i 've summarized why .
there are those renewables , how they often be called .
and also have -- although it 's awesome is that they make any fuel needs -- they have some downsides .
one is the caloric energy , of these technologies create dramatic lower than most of <unk> .
this is <unk> , you talk from a lot <unk> , 1,000 times more land , as a common plant .
and behind these resources from disruption .
the sun shines , not all day , it seems to do n't have a day , and the way it blows with the wind and not the time .
so you have , if you of these vent 's dependent on , a way to have to the energy as well in times when they do n't available there is , to get .
there are so large <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if we like to say , the power station outside of israel itself , you do n't just the technology , they also need to the risk of difficulty that the energy from where else comes from .
and there is that <unk> .
and around the level to show , i 've all kinds of life , they 're built , typing , the work with automobiles , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and i did with the amount of electronic energy , which the world 's using , comparing them . i found that all the batteries are now producing , less than 10 minutes of maintains storing up .
we need so here 's a big advancement , something that make a factor of 100 times better will be , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not so easily .
that happens when you 're trying to these <unk> sources of put 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest to bring .

now , where should we go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project ? how we come to the goal ?
what we need are many companies , the working . hundreds .
in each of these five separate enterprises , we need at least 100 people .
for many of you will say , who are crazy ! it 's good .
i think , here in the ted community , many who have been engaged .
bill by any more different companies , among other one named <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies who do awesome things and interesting ways to have and i 'm going to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company , the , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; and modular , liquid .
the development has in this industry while back to end , so it 's no big surprise that some good ideas , lying .
this <unk> which means , you instead of a part of <unk> , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent to burn , that <unk> .
this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you about time thinking , but you could never been properly for machine , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputer that there , you can actually simulate and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent is burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , you the garbage , and you can even the waste of today reactors operate as <unk> use .
rather be about the head to break , burn it 's easy . a cool thing .
this highly enriched uranium is being incremental and it uses , a little bit like a candle that .
you see that 's a bar is , often , `` a traveling wave of the reactor . '' he calls .
that solves another thing that <unk> .
here 's a picture of nowhere in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part of the right now to burn it 's going to <unk> so there 's <unk> uranium .
this exercise , the u.s. for hundreds of years on .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get plenty of fuel for the rest of our lifetimes of the planet .
you know , there yet many challenges , but it 's an example among many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we , how we our success rate them .
how should our own testimony to be ?
now , we go to put her goal , that we might have and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many are talking about an 80 percent reduction , by 2050 .
it 's really important that we go to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poorest countries to be created , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean .
so , about these 80 percent to get to have the industrialized nations , including the countries like china , their <unk> completely change .

that 's great importance .
this becomes an element of this <unk> .
if we 're off the back to , how did this by 2020 as testament to be ?
it should n't forget the two elements in them .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the on the way to having this as any less we <unk> , the more low is the <unk> be and it also the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things we do that do n't fully to the big , <unk> lead , just a moment , or even slightly less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for these amazing breakthroughs in the money .
this amazing breakthroughs , we need to you floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books about this topic .
that al gore 's `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the hot air . ''
they take it really through and create a framework where this wide the universe begin to do , because we need to support from all sides .
there 's something that comes together to .
this is a wish .
a very specific than the desire for us to this technology making .
you i 'm just a wish for the next 50 years or worse , i could the president to choose , a vaccine , and that i love , or i could this desire to choose who says , <unk> <unk> without adding co2 being invented . this desire to pushing me .
this is the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get , which is digging in between the term , and the short user do terrible people are , between the united states and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse .
what we need to do then ?
for those measures <unk> i ?
we need for more funding in the minds .
if countries themselves in places like <unk> meeting , they should not only about carbon .
they should those <unk> to talk , and they were shocked by the ridiculous , very low <unk> , in these other cutting-edge approaches to spend .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we have about the rational and full of take and also the things , from the government to be undertaken .
it 's an important notion , but i think we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just <unk> bit better to understand -- yeah , you can make us an idea of the scale that investment to be ?
bill gates : for the simulation in a supercomputer to campaign , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need a few of 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear power to test have to make sure that it 's reasonable that works , is you just in the <unk> million .
the tricky step is the building of the first <unk> , another six billion to find that <unk> and the ground in the fact , the first of building .
once the first time . it 's when he 's how as i promised , then everything is clearly , because the economy , the caloric energy is so different than with <unk> , how we know it .
by the right to understand : this means the deep in the ground to build a little bit like a vertical pillar of nuclear <unk> , that car fleet <unk> and then begin in the process of the top , and working out went down ?
bg : yeah . now you have the reactor ever again need , so many people and lots of the tuned to go wrong . this thing where you know it opens and things <unk> or the causes . this is not good .
but when you very cheap fuel is , you can see him for 60 years we need -- i think about a column -- that they bury , without all the complexities of .
and it 's sitting there , and they burn for 60 years and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , the self is the solution for the garbage county .
bg : yeah . now , what do with the junk that happens : you can see him sitting here -- there are much less junk that with this method -- then take him and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start to make the garbage can take that 's already exists , the inside these <unk> or <unk> at the reactor is . this is our <unk> .
so that 's , which for these reactors run a problem was , that which we in your fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people that world of those choices we 've talked ,
where is the main interest , so what really happen ?
bg : well , we 've still not on a place in setting up there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there are passion and people from a company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and i have the minister of them and talking about it , like this to <unk> matches .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese had something in the direction .
this is another version of one thing that was taken .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a very quickly this reactor and some countries have this building , why is anyone who 's a whirlwind the event might play has to a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , the horizon , and the probability is something really , where to call ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that you 're very affordable , we secured 20 years to make up , and then 20 years to use .
this is like the deadline , us the <unk> has illustrated that we write contracts .
and , you know , <unk> , if all walks , and that 's a wish , it could easily give them .
and fortunately , there today , dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of the , as well , if those approaches worked , the funding for its operator to work , for <unk> can .
and it would be the most , if it works together , because then you could a mixture of use .
in any case we need a solution .
review of the major types breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is that <unk> .
this is it even without the <unk> been , but that makes it so much more important .
in a nuclear sector has some innovative companies .
you know , we 've met whose job is not just about this , but there are modular way , this is a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> which is something that seems , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there are different , but the beauty in this is that a <unk> a million times as much energy 's like a , we 're saying , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems to deal with and they are called the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a kind of a league table .
if it does n't work , then what ?
we have <unk> i introduce to try to the rise in the same place to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation where , it 's as if you ate too much has , and before going from heart . what do you go ? you must be a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> are <unk> called , are about various techniques , involved in which to the warming to delay , so we 20 or 30 years more family around us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you pray that we do n't need .
some people say , you should not only on the insurance will work because you do that might be lazy , so you do n't stop eating , because you know that one of the <unk> save them will .
i do n't know , if this smart , is , if you look at the importance of this problem front of the table , but there 's a larger discourse in <unk> about whether it be available to have to , if the things faster come , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
change deniers like you have a or two lines for the to you might have to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , in the skeptics in very different bully out .
the ones who scientific data points to let 's very much .
they say , there are negative effect there , the with the clouds to do , the things are shifting ?
there 's very , very few things that you even able to say , where it 's a chance in a million there .
the main problem here 's like with aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for much later .
and so it 's the idea , now , if you all kinds compiled all have issues , in something to invest in that you do n't until later , which was -- and comes up , that the investment is not that 's obvious . actually is the ipcc report did n't exactly the worst possible scenario and there are people in the wealthy world about climate change everywhere , and say , okay , that 's no big , drama .
the fact that uncertainty of we care .
but my dream of this is that , if you can be economically can do , and with this carbon over , then say also the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't interest me that it 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost , that this was doing , but i 'm going to it would accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that , if you look at that time and energy use around the co2 problem with solving , all the other outcomes have suffered , the <unk> , the fight from malaria and so on that 's a stupid waste of resources , is to pay to invest , as it better stuff is that we can do .
bg : well , the actual expenses for the research -- let the u.s. would have 10 billion per year after , to spend when they do today -- that 's not quite dramatic .
there were other things not suffer .
you come up to big <unk> , and here to make reasonable people disagree with , if you something has to do n't have economic growth is , and tried to this to finance . for me is happening here , most of waste .
it was because , you is very shortly before a <unk> and financed , just the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> , the you get , a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich to keep up .
i mean , each of us here i could take five times as much for our energy to spend , without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the science may not talking about ? ''
he 's still , because of his previous lives , with <unk> associated , but he understood that a very rare group is , and so it 's now that <unk> .
and this is a line that i came to be appropriate to keep them .
the research , it 's just nuts , how much in the aid becomes .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i 'm really her wish i realized that 's going to many , thanks .
bg : thanks .
several years ago , here at ted , i made , peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> have the biggest off-the-grid structure with 20 spaghetti , i think about . pavona tape , i think about . pavona thread , and a marshmallow , building .
the marshmallow is stuck on top .
and , although it really straightforward looks like , it 's actually really hard , because it people to push you very quickly work together .
and so i thought was this is an interesting idea is , and i did it in a <unk> transformed .
it was a huge success .
since i have about 70 workshops and the world run , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something about this task , what a profound insights into the nature of cooperation into city and i want some of them to share with .
we tend to start the most people themselves in terms of the task to orient .
you talk , you look at how it looks down , they <unk> to do ,
then putting them a little time in planning and organization . you drawing and put our eating spaghetti out .
they invest in a lot of their time to build the time wellness -- structures
and finally , shortly before they do n't go to have more , taking somebody the marshmallow and they put him gently down on top , entering a step back , `` <unk> ! '' admire their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that `` <unk> '' to a <unk> '' is , because that weight of the marshmallow does that the whole thing is actually curls and <unk> .
there 's a number of people who are much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and under the worst of fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> structure .
and there of course , other teams who are much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and under the best is to draw the alumni of this kindergarten .
and this is quite astonishing .
so let peter to tell you make it 's not just the highest towers , but most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask them is : how that ? why ? what about whom ?
and peter told , `` none of the kids spend time it 's head of eating spaghetti <unk> to be .
they invest in any time in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and it changes that mba students a whole were to a real plan to find , ok !
and it will be to realize .
then what happens when you the marshmallow book on the top of package , you have no time more and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what kindergarten do differently , this is that they do with the marshmallow is beginning and prototypes to build a successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they were numerous times the ability to have <unk> prototypes to fix it .
constructionists see this kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get the children are directly feedback , what works and what do n't .
so is the performance , using prototypes to work , far -- but we see once , how different teams of imagery .
the average for most 's around about . <unk> that mba students make half of that , lawyer , something more , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than adults .
who 's most successful ?
architects and engineers , to happiness .
pavona is the ultimate , what i saw .
and why ? because they are triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build systems to build .
the ceos are about average . but here it gets interesting .
you put an executive that administrator at the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see around and see that `` this team will win . ''
you can predict . why does it ?
because they have special powers , the <unk> have .
they pour the process , you understand him .
and here 's team that regulates body and on the work to pay attention to the performance of teams to dramatically improve .
print your skills and <unk> and combined , lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical by going to get you ca . six to build systems have .
i tried now , something interesting .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so drastically , i have 10,000 dollars a price of software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had to build a structure .
if someone on a <unk> of construction of being taken out , he could have the price goes home the globe .
so it 's not interesting is that high <unk> a profound effect of ?
we reenacted this exercise to share a student .
what they think it was happening now ?
well understood that the advantage of `` <unk> .
so i was the same , bad news crew , one among the best .
they have produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
there , so , <unk> lessons for us about nature of the incentive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually go to invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i training digital tools and processes to create , by two teams to help , cars , games and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is , it helps them to hide your mind to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge and offers a shared experience , a common language , or sterility . ethos , the right prototype stage to build .
and this is the value of this experience , so these basic skills practice .
and those of them to be interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow , building .
there 's a <unk> there .
you find a crazy examples of the world , how people that telescope and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is , this structure actually a <unk> sports is .
it requires that we all our senses at the challenge the space , and that our thinking optimally use , like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us is .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a <unk> '' moment to bring .
and that can see a huge difference .
thank you .
we do something like we can see a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everyone in this room must go inside .
and they can go into the past go , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here and now , still ,
and i wonder , what you vote would , because i my friends at the last time choosing these particular question was , and they wanted everybody in the past and go .
i do n't know . they wanted to the time ago , before it cars were or twitter or `` america 's looking for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i am confident that you kind of nostalgia , to wishful drawn is .
and that i understanding .
i 'm not a bunch of the group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and that 's not , because i always , adventurers , i am .
it 's because that are out of this planet does n't go back , you go ahead .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future to go .
this is the greatest time , the it , depending on planet , however , what scale , they make : health , wealth , and mobility , and opportunity , at declining <unk> .
there was never before a time , like this .
my <unk> died from all when they had been .
my grandparents had urged this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 percent at the heels .
there should be better be 9 at my <unk> are .
but it 's not just about people like us , because this is a major thing as this .
a child , that today in delhi , born , are you can expect , so long time living as the richest man on the world , 100 years ago .
you think about it for . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on planet killed .
they have the demographics of the ground in a way to be shaped , how it 's no war , ever done .
they 're gone . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . go pfft .
in the wealthy world are diseases , the millions of us from the only one generation also threatened by , hardly anything .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
i know , it does anybody else , what ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed these successes of scientific method .
and from my perspective is the scientific method that would try to look , if it works , it to change , if it does n't do , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately is that all the news , because there is a few other problems , and they were frequently said ,
and one of this is that despite all of our greatest achievements , a billion people in the world every day they 're hungry , to bed and go .
this number drops , and she goes very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and not only thing , we have our ability to be used to this world spend time to trash .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , which was soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> go so we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people eat it will never , this country , on her life , to rape her .
i think we can this world with power which they are not both being destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not wishful thinking .
but this keeps me at night , wake up -- one thing to me at night , wake up . we have scientific advances are never seen these really needed it is now , never ,
and we were also never in a position , it 's reasonable <unk> , like us , it today .
we 're on the cusp of amazing , amazing event in many places . and yet , i think about that we are hundreds of 300 years ago , the enlightenment , go back and they needed to a time to find , in our advances are fighting now , where we about these things <unk> <unk> have , at all these lines of as well .
people putting yourself in their faith , which is so intimately that you do n't be free will .
do n't even the truth will they free .
and they stop , nobody is right on his mind ; even a right on their opinion , for progress ,
but you know , where you ca n't you are right ?
they do n't quite on their own facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while i needed to figure that .
back about a decade , i have an article about the shots for `` the new yorker , '' written , a small paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to bump , on the resistance towards the , what the end of the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity 's .
i 'm not know what i should do , so i did you know what i always doing , i wrote an article and i went on .

the same story , only bigger .
people did one crazy .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand , why people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecule in a certain moment rather an accidental pieces of move a <unk> on the area of nature was .
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i wrote this paper , i kept going .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we tap , we can take a , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were troubled me , and i could n't figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and this is because that these <unk> , the me nuts were all ? no <unk> were .
that were prudent people , educated people , a decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and i was such a mess .
but then i thought , you know what , whether we 're honest .
we 're at the stage now gotten in which we 're not the same relationship to the progress we have as before .
we 're talking <unk> them .
we talk to be ironic that , with a little quotes about `` the progress .
okay , there are some reasons , and i think we know the kind of reasons that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in science in getting lost , and there 's no reason that 's not that should be .
you can just a couple of names we call , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can maintain their own list them .
there are questions and problems with the people , where we believed that they always right now . so be skeptical .
so you ask , costing me the evidence that urge you some evidence .
take nothing for granted .
but now comes from it : if you evidence to get you have this evidence to assume , and there are we 're not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say , we now in an epidemic of fear of life , as i 'd never saw and hopefully will never see again will .
back about 12 years was a story posted , a horrific story , the <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine working in a back .
very scary .
plenty of studies have done to see if that was true .
plenty of trial should be conducted ; it 's very serious .
the data came in .
the data came in the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all together , any correlation , no link , no .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we all of anecdotes for thinking , we think , what we see what we show up to believe what does that we really feel .
we do n't think about a bunch of documents from one <unk> , of us data available , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating ,
catastrophic , because of this fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where the immunization rate of <unk> rate .
this is absolutely scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened , that we could do .
now , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because it is someone <unk> ?
now i , in the audience ever somebody into <unk> die see ?
it 's not many times .
what happens in this country at all , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because it 's not happening here is , we can be caring , and people who were jenny mccarthy , can walk around and sending messages of fear and illiteracy around the platforms like the oprah and larry king live to preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and some correlation should give up .
they do n't understand that these things that does seem to be , but almost never the same thing is .
and this is something that we need to learn , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
it liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , not the distress , polio , and phew , which vanished .
the guy in the center 's not so .
he says economist paul <unk> .
he just with some other people a <unk> .
he does the life of <unk> , 500,000 in children per year in the developing to rescue .
well . not ?
well , this is well , except that what paul walk through and through vaccines to talk , and says , how valuable they are , and that just people quit while i want to complain .
and that he says , as indeed .
paul 's so a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , it can not without being armed occasion to give you .
he 's getting calls home with , because people would like to tell that you know where his kids going to school .
and why ? paul a vaccine has done .
i do n't say that , but the vaccines are essential .
you take it continues to drop these maladies come back , terrible disease , and this is happening .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon going to kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just about <unk> die .
what about polio ? take that 's why not ?
a <unk> of mine got me on a few weeks , writing and said she told , i 'm a little too <unk> .
nobody has that ever said earlier .
they would their children did not against polio immunized . no way .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't polio could have . and you know what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , none of polio virus .
now , i do n't know , maybe i had this morning guy in lagos , a plane and you fly straight to los angeles , right now he of ohio .
and in a few hours before landing he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight and visit .
and he does n't know that it with one of debilitating condition that infects one is , and we know that 's also not , because it 's how the world now time .
this is the planet , on the we live . they do n't so , as if he does n't think about .
we love to us in the lie to mutate . we love this .
you have this morning everybody their supply vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you to sit still .
i know that they did , because half the americans , that every day .
you take this stuff , and they make an alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find that they 're useless .
the data analyzed the time .
you , dimming to their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , you want to 70 million dollars for the dark , urine .
i agree with them , entirely too .
the darker the urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i 'm sorry -- we hate the industry .
we hate to be too strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should not . our healthcare is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> make us that they can afford .
we go so before that way , and where do we ?
we walk into the poor of the <unk> .
that 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars to this .
and i 've all kinds of little artifacts , here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , because i do n't even what that is , but we spend billions of dollars to this , it 's very serious .
and you know what ? when i 'm saying that , scream at me , people in and say `` what looks like you ? let the folks ai n't do , what they want .
so it feels good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i donâ€™t care is , whether it 's the minister is who says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of my research to mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , of their patient with <unk> treat us to go .
if you look at this road entering , where i think , and magic of evidence and science to replace , get them on a place , where they do n't want to be .
they get to , thabo mbeki 's in south africa .
he was 400,000 of people around , because it was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much better than any antiretroviral drugs are , where we know that you the course of aids , braking system .
hundreds undue death in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
tell me , please do n't know that stuff did n't have consequences are .
they get them . they get them forever .

this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , over the metaphor .
this ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everyone about brussels sprouts , was from the people changed .
you know , it was no <unk> in the garden .
it was no <unk> .
it was no christmas tree . we have this all done .
we have it in the last for 11,000 years .
and some of work and some of it 's not .
we 're got rid of what did n't work .
now we can be more to do . and of course there risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
does n't you want to do ?
i must say , understand that i do n't .

why we do that ?
now , what i 'll keep hearing is : too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want a huge areas with one thing , it 's wrong .
we do n't know that companies alive and patent .
we do n't know that companies that seeds have .
and you know what my answer to all these things ?
yes , they are right . fix this .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but this is not science .
this has to do nothing to do .
it 's right , right now , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company is .
it 's no country .
it is less than an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we the science is not allow them , your work to do , because we fear made this is a truly dead , and they would keep millions of people from a flourishing taking off .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to 70 percent longer growing food to be on right . 70 percent .
that investment in africa in the last 30 years .
i 'm ashamed of shame .
they need that , and we give you do n't .

we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's something like a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it does n't draw nutrients , it 's not a protein , and scientists building that all right at a .
and then you could people that food and would n't be blind be .
they would never saw starvation , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i learned that can say is : why would fight us that ?
i mean , we wonder : why would fight us that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , genetics move . it 's not about the chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our insisting on the greater our food , better food , unique food .
it 's not by minute rice <unk> , it 's about people are alive to get , and it becomes our first time , to understand what that means .
because you see what ?
if we do n't do this , if we so on doing as far -- let 's in a little bit guilty , where we , i think , not guilty about trying to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for this , what happened here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it is not worthy , and we have this really stop them .
after this incredible funny , entertainment , they want so we might say , i will you still in this ridiculous machine , and in the future to go ? ''
in any case . that i want to any rate .
now , put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see this machine to anything to ask , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we 're moving to , and we 're going forward to move , where we want .
we have these conversations with , and we need to think , but if we in the machine only growing up in the future , go , we will be happy to be done this to have .
i know that we can , and as they 're really concerned that 's something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while i 'm interested in the <unk> . it seem curious thing when a magician interested in that think it 's because , you look at it , like this , as `` a deception , the to something real space is , if somebody being tightly enough to believe . ''
in other words , <unk> have in some trials a measurable effect , i showed the <unk> , which is just so , because the person thinks , what to happen to be a pharmaceutical facilities , or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there , if the patient who , tightly enough to believe , a measurable effect in the body that you the <unk> calls .
a delusion is going to something real , because somebody using this experience .
so we each other 's also understanding , i want to a fundamental , very simple trick them .
and i 'm going to show how he works . this is a trick at least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for kids ' .
i even have him from <unk> scout in magic the mars scout in the 1970s .
i 'm going to him for them explaining , and it will explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'll explain .
so , you see , what happens .
that knife , that they 're analyzing them ; my hand , the you look .
i 'm going to the knife , just like in my own traction , often .
i 'm not pleading my sleeve .
and make sure that nothing in my sleeve , he comes up or from him out later , i 'll just my wrist , right here <unk> .
this way you can see that look at any time something that moved . long as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , hiking , or paint it .
and the goal here 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand , open , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical , magnetics rice mill .
it sits actually so stuck on its place that i do n't shake it can never , that knife falls .
nothing goes into my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and they can look at .
<unk> !

probably know many of them in the room that trick .
he works following :
i think that knife in the hand .
i say that i got my wrist <unk> to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , he comes up or a result , and this is a lie .
the reason that i my wrist <unk> , is that at the real secret of the illusion is .
in the moment in fact , where i my hand of you <unk> , with them from the back to see , moving this point here , my main index , just from where he was , in a position , where he basically extended is .
wonderful trick ?
because theyâ€™re going down to someone who 's not a childhood had .
so , he sits down here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a delusion is , why do n't perceive that down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way of information processing , they 're not one by counting , one , two , three , but it as a group can see .
but it 's about now here 's not actually . and then i open my hand .
course it will have written down , but not working through , magnetics my body , but through a trick , through my main index , the right now there is .
and when i my hand , i head , on the same thing , by myself <unk> , in fact that movement , unseen , that the trigger-pullers go back <unk> .
i 'll use these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick we can keep your friends and the neighbors just run . thanks .
now , which was the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that i really just blew up .
i 'm not a doctor or explorers , and so it was that for me an amazing thing .
it has been following it turns out : if you a <unk> in a white pill i described , in the form of a <unk> , is that just a game , white pill , the that a measurable effect .
but if you the shape , where you that <unk> ingredient , for example , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter after , cloaking them , is indeed , it 's measurable , effectively .
and that , although almost none of shape or pharmaceutical facilities -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white ball is not just about a blue pill .
what ? it caused me really crazy .
it turned out , but it out that would n't stop is .
if you capsules are coming out , are more effective than tablets of every form .
a colored the capsule , the to be over the yellow and across the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
well , the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not just about three pills -- so i 'm not at the exact statistics on today . i 'm sorry .
the key , but is , `` ...
... that kind of high doses of play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle , fall .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- some <unk> a <unk> substance that you a patient , injecting cancer .
this is a very powerful image in mind . this is very much worse than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to them another time to show you make a <unk> have .
the fact , so this is that the white ball and not just like the blue pill , the not just like a cramped capsule were not just like the needle .
and none had some really have pharmaceutical facilities , property . it 's only our faith in the inside ourselves a greater impact achieved .
i wanted to know if i did this idea for a trick could use .
i take something that obviously a delusion is , and make it 's gon na look .
we know it look at the study that you to the needle and grabbing something , if it to deal supposed to go .
this is an 18 square inch long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you start with a little bit to render time .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that is no effect of hollywood .
i 'm going to this needle in my skin and bite zip through them to push , until you on the other hand , again hats .
if you the culprit is -- if you 're in <unk> fall -- i 've done some friends , the last night in the hotel room by raising , and some people who i did n't know , and that 's a woman comes close to faint .
i propose , so ago , if you very quickly the culprit is , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part of back here .
they could about to see , you can also <unk> , if you want .
so , and it goes , right here , where my ham starts , bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a small one puncture , do .
'm really sorry . they make this crazy ?
and i 'm just a little bit through my skin and on the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same condition that we do the <unk> had .
about .
but now you can be my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what people think , if you see that .
they say `` okay , who 's certainly not so stupid and <unk> itself in the skin , just for us a few minutes long to communicate . ''
now , i will be able to show you .
what this out ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people behind , `` okay . i do n't actually seen . ''
people in the <unk> come from pure .
let 's me give you from near the same time .
it 's so my skin . that is no effect of hollywood .
this is my ham , and i can that 's swivel around .
i 'm sorry . if you the culprit is going to look away , donâ€™t look carefully .
people back or the ones that that later , some point on video to see , will say , `` well , that 's probably fairly impressive out , but if it 's gon na be , he would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really cool would , it would we bleed . ''
okay , let me some blood for you <unk> .
yes , it there .
usually i 'd go through the needle elements .
i would my arm safe and show that there 's no lesions are .
but i think , in this experiment here and with the intention , from a delusion is something we had to do , i 'm going to the needle , just in there , me , and so from the stage to go .
we are the next few days a couple more time you look .
i hope that you look forward has been on . thank you .
everybody wants to talk today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books are now , the with `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years under that were and they gave up about 40 up , and there was a lot more .
there 's a massive wave of interest in luck of explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like people are happier .
but despite all of tide of work , there 's a cognitive function break that 's kind of almost impossible to make sure about happiness might think .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive pop into action .
this is for layman to come over their own happiness will think , and it 's for scientists who was fortunate to think , because it turns out that we so just mess that we 're like everybody else .
the first of those mind is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns out that word that fortunate to do n't put a useful for more is , because we put too many different things work .
i think there 's a particular meaning , on the thing we shrink it could , but by individuals and the whole thing that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated view would have to what well-being is .
the second case is a confuse , of experience and memory , basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we do n't know you are capable to think we can , the well-being is affected , without its significance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive and trap .
there is simply no way , it right down to get .
now i 'd like with an example start by someone who 's a <unk> had to one of my lectures that 's a story told . [ unclear ... '' he said he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely splendid music , and very end of recording was a <unk> <unk> the sound .
and then he included in addition , really quite emotionally , that 's the whole experience of ruins .
but that i did n't .
what it ruined had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience them anyway .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care ca n't , because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory that was ruined , and the memory that was the end , what he to keep getting had .
what we really that says this is that we come over and about other people think we could in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> itself , that in the presence today lives and the present to know , is able to the past , back to experience , but basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , `` do it 's got sore , when i do here <unk> ? ''

or `` how was their voyage to albania ? '' or something .
these are two very different entities that <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and the two to confuse this is part of muddle , of <unk> from happiness .
well , this <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really with a basic reaction to our memories of -- it begins immediately started .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we get in which stories to tell .
our memory , tells stories , i mean , what we of our experiences , who would be allowed is a story .
and let <unk> with an example start .
there is an old study .
this is real patients who became a painful procedure that brain scanner .
i 'm not going into detail and go . they now is n't hurt anymore , but she was painful , as this study in the 1990s was taken .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and these are two patients . that 's her records .
and they 're asking `` who by both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient , let 's clearly have suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient and i 'd had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how much i thought that these patients that you suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient as a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a person b .
the stories <unk> were different , and because a very big part of the story is , how she stops .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one is this shows ...
but one is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is the , where the pain , very end up its zenith , was . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we all these people for their <unk> ask you have , and too much later , `` how much was the whole thing in general ? well ,
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct fight between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even had a b is clearly a <unk> time .
now , what you 're using patient and i could do , and we 've actually a clinical experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to increase by showing you just the hose in it 's not too much about him to shakes things .
this is going to result , that the patient 's suffering , but just a bit and much less than before .
and if you that 's a few minutes long makes you have circuits that <unk> from the patient of the a worse off , and you have circuits that <unk> from the patient as much better off is , because now , you have a patient as a story about his experience changed .
and basically ooh , a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory of us to give you and it is true for the stories that we invent .
and basically , a story i think are <unk> , great moments , and ends .

well , this <unk> own lives in his life and continuously .
so there are moments of <unk> , a time .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're be lost forever .
i mean , most of moments of our lives -- and i have the calculations â€” â€” you know , the psychological presence being hard about three seconds long . which means you know that it 's in a life about 600 million of them . there 's in a month there 's about 600,000 articles . most of you leave any track .
most of you can be completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet they get in the sense that they are supposed to realize what happens during those moments of <unk> on our lives is .
it 's the finite resource that we use as we 're in the world are .
and how we they consume it would seem to matter , but this is not the story that this <unk> even for us engaged .
so we have the <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the people interact with time .
of view of <unk> itself , if you a holiday are and the other week , equally as well , is how the first , then is the <unk> vacation 's twice as good the <unk> vacation .
how does n't for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's much better than the <unk> holiday , because there is no new memories , added to be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and this way is time in the edge variable that a <unk> itself is different from one <unk> itself . time has very much impact on this story .
well , this <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .

this <unk> itself has no voice in that election .
so we choose not just sort of experiences . we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we at the future thinking , we think about our future is n't usually as painful experiences .
we think about our future for as <unk> memories .
and basically , can you look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can think that <unk> even think more than one , this sort , <unk> even <unk> through experience , the <unk> do n't need .
i have the impression that if we travel to do that a lot of the case is , that means we make a vacation largely on services of <unk> itself .
and this is a little bit hard to justify so , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations that for the dominance of <unk> even gave this is .
and when i think about , i think about a holiday , the we 're on a few years in antarctica that made , the clearly the best to travel was that i ever had , and i think quite frequently used in proportion to how often i think about other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i thought about the folder open , you could come up with 600 of photographs in this , i would have another time spent .
well , this is three weeks , and that 's peak half hours .
because it seems a disagreement is to give .
now , i like a little extreme to be , you know , there , how little appetites , i on the <unk> of memories i have , but even if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we spend their memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we experiences be ?
so i want to keep them on an experiment to think .
think of their next to travel ago , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures and obliterate it will and they get a <unk> drug , which is now you do n't remember .
now , they would the same travel to vote ?
and if you another travel to vote would , there a conflict between her two types of self , and you need to think about how do this conflict to decide which is a really started not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think they might say another answer to get .
why we are <unk> pick out that we chose this is an issue that makes us , put them with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , pull two words from fortune on .
there are actually two concepts of the lucky ones that we can use , one per second self .
so they can ask : how happy , is that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy , these moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- fortunately for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that might be measured them ?
and , the way , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you off of luck of <unk> yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about how happy one person who lives .
it is about how happy or enjoy the person is , if this person on your life today .
so unlike the term .
everybody , of those terms of not unlike is probing the fortunes to screw it , and i belong to a lot of scientists about comfort , the study of happiness was screwed that have in fact , the way .
the distinction between happiness of <unk> self and the average happiness of <unk> itself is in the last decade has realized that 's been , and so anxious you think that each separately , to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , at the more than a half million people ask anybody who had been about what you about your life thinking and over her experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
in the last years we 've got started out of the lucky , the two types of self to learn .
and the main thing that we , i think , we 've learned is that they actually vary .
you ca n't know how to please anybody with his life is , and that teaches you really not much about how happy to be able to live lives and vice versa .
just show you a sense of the correlation to convey , the correlation is about <unk> .
what this is that if you know someone would meet and you would tell them , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about his greatness all know ?
now , they were about its scale know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have much uncertainty .
if i tell that someone your life than eight at a scale of 10 <unk> did you have much uncertainty about how happy , he 's using his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the average happiness of <unk> the up .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means , very pleased to be with people who we like , time to spend with people who we 'd like .
there are other occupational pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you that happiness , the two types of self to maximize that we want you 'll end very different things do .
the implication of the , what i 'm here was saying is that we 're lucky to do n't imagine you better than a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , another reason , from that we do n't know about happiness might think we can this is that we 're not on the same things should care if we think about this life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question , as happy people in california are you will not the correct response time .
if you this question , you think that people in california , happy to be if you , we 're saying , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think , you think about the difference in california , and elsewhere , and that difference is , we 're saying , in climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful about ourselves , that decides you how happy people are .
now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you can you end -- some people might end to california to move .
and it 's kind of interesting to track of what happens with people who to california , pulling in the hope , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not become happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think you happier lives are , because if you think about you will be remembered it will , how awful lot of the weather in ohio was . and they 're going to feel that it 's the right decision point out .
it 's very difficult , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i would pass an idea of transcendence , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for them .
thank you .
now , when we 're on a few weeks , the phone , we 've mentioned her to me that 's a pretty interesting thing was that 's out of these <unk> survey found myself .
this is something , what they 're participating . they can , because they 're a few minutes left would have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we 're in the <unk> survey found have is a number that we absolutely not to find we did .
we thought this in terms of the luck of <unk> itself .
if we looked like , emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out that 's an income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big representative sample , under an income is about 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 years .
dk : look .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are n't happy , and they 're increasingly less happy , the poorer . they 're going .
what we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat line seen .
what happens , is obvious that the money 's not <unk> obtaining them , but that lack of money one certainly the misery obtaining them , and we can be one of misery very , right rate .
in terms of other self , of <unk> itself , they get another story .
the more money you deserve better satisfaction is you .
this is not in emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort is about life , freedom , this quest for happiness .
when people that database seriously , we would take , i mean , it seems like everything on its head to ask , everything , what we think , for example with tax policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country , generally a database , like the severity of your dignity , and based on politics were to make ?
dk : you know , i think about recognition , there for the role <unk> in politics .
the recognition , we 're being in the united states , no question , but in the uk does it right and in other countries on it right .
people are starting to acknowledge them to be in luck to think should , if you about politics , thinking .
it will be a while , and people will discuss them , if you <unk> look like , or whether they <unk> look like , so we have this discussion is pretty soon bring .
how fortunate to raise your element is very differently depending upon which you think and if you know about this <unk> even consider whether you about this <unk> even imagine .
that will require policy changes , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you look at the <unk> the population of measuring .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national science data .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should at least most exciting for political debate to pursue be over the next few years .
thanks for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i design games .
i think now the last 10 years , online game . and my goal for the next decade is , it as easy to do , the world in reality to save so , in <unk> to save is .
i have a design for . i want more people agree , including all of them , more time with the play a bigger and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games . ''
perhaps slightly too much time , when you 've given how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve are .
but in fact , my research at the center for the future , that , is the exact opposite accurately .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to the never facing the world to solve .
indeed , i 'm convinced that , if we do the next century on planet to survive want to do this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that required at age 21 billion hours , whatâ€™s per week is .
this appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so we are you ca : if we problems like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i think , we need to try to play online for at least , 21 billion hours per week from the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this says there 's very much , why i think about play , so critical for survival of the human species in the future are . seriously .
this is a picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings in play catch . so he was the players have a camera and i built .
this is one of the classic expressions as to play .
if you do n't players are , suppose you may be some of nuances in this picture .
so you probably this sense of urgency , a little freaked , but also the yankees , concentration , very delves into this sort of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see certain nuances . here , the way up <unk> eyes and the mouth is an indication about optimism . the eyebrows present to surprise .
this is a player , the edge of a so-called <unk> victory .
oh , you know that . ok. good . so we have some outstanding players , here .
a <unk> victory is a result , that 's extremely positive is that they were n't even knew that it ever was possible .
it was almost go beyond the imagination .
and if they do , they 're shocked out that they actually to something like 're capable of this is a <unk> victory .
these gamer is about a <unk> victory .
and this is it , what we 're going on millions of faces of service reps and over the world 's got , if we these hurdles , of the next century in attacking . the face of people , the sunshine of all odds on the edge of a <unk> victory and age .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we are difficult problems facing .
i call it , than the in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
this is me , like me that , in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti on my former home at berkley , california , where i in my ph.d. studying why we in games are better than in real life .
this is an issue that many of gamers have .
we think we in reality is not just are like in games .
and i 'm not just sort of success , though that moment .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean well with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to collaborate together .
if we in a <unk> are , i believe that lots of us into the best we would turn , anytime and immediately helpful to are , intractable as the problem with solving try , as long necessary , it off of failure through a little taste .
and in reality , if we fail , if we are obstacles to hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel curing cancer . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in play it 's just not .
and this is it , what i was a phd want to look .
why is it into play an impossible to think , you could n't reach it all ?
how do these feelings of the play in the reality to translate them ?
so i started looking at play like the world of warcraft with that the ideal place for towards a problem solving county .
and i have some things i discovered , the epic victories in <unk> how do .
so , first , if you in one of these online game make it , especially with world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters who are willing to give a <unk> mission <unk> , and now .
but not just some of the mission , but a mission , the perfect , to her current level at play out , right ?
so do you that .
they have no one task that you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so they need to try . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and twirl , we dicked around . there are always very specific and something important to do .
and there 's plenty of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people who engage with you know , you very epic mission blue bar .
that we have in real life , not just like , that feeling that in a <unk> tons of employees agreed to stand .
there are also this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we 're having to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they 've determined by `` level up '' and `` plus-one magnitude , '' or heard `` plus-one emotional intelligence .
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage , leaving , i did not , is plus-one talking and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback , not .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , is that it really quite gratifying it is , 24/7 working on the edge of a <unk> victory to stand out that we prefer our whole time in that 's <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
day i 've all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years spent , the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but about it 's in context to see , before <unk> million years , began our first <unk> continue to go .

ok , so if we talk , how much time we currently on play , though , it does that sense , when you look at the time in terms of scale of human development in front of how , what 's extremely is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out that we 're going to make this whole time getting to play using , actually changing this , what we as people in are capable of .
we create us to collaborative user , indeed beings .
this is the truth . it , i believe .
and look at this thing about statistics , the given away from a researcher at carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today , in a country with potent <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , from two reasons :
first time , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> which they are in school , though , of the five . grade to finish the high school -- if you never absent .
so we have here a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning , what it means , a good players to be , like everything else , what you in school to learn .
and may have some of the new book of encountering malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know about his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it builds on the great terms of <unk> that , if we scraped 10,000 hours with that laborious degree of any subject matter to the 21st century . age , though , we 're going to solving this .
we are so good at whatever to do , like most important single person 's the world .
so , what we have here 's a whole generation of young people who <unk> are .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are the players are failing really ? ''
because if we could figure that would we 're kind of before there <unk> human potential to spend .
so many people are currently in the world , the least an hour 's a day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who is exceptionally good in `` something '' are .
and the next decade we have another billion player , the remarkably well in whatever .
if you see if you do n't have heard ,
the industry develops <unk> , the energy savings and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online games .
you 're throwing another billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started out to look at what it is , what one of us these games to solving .
here is the four things that i found . first thing : <unk> .
ok , think that as the extreme <unk> ago .

i think always remember that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it is always be worth , it to try , which is equal .
players are not sit around .
players are masters of spiders poet of social networks .
there 's a lot more interesting discussion , the show that we people more like , after we do you 've been playing , even if you 're evil to beat them .
the reason is that 's a lot of trust takes , with a game to play .
we rely on that somebody out with us to spend that the rules honored to us to the same as we 've got to the drums , to remain that .
so what allows this <unk> that grow out of ties to trust and each other .
a number of that we build greater understanding social relations in .
<unk> productivity . fantastic .
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , as it as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're really happy that are hard to work , as if we relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal , work , if we were hard , great job done .
and the players are always ready , hard to work , if you the real challenge to get .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> achieve critical to be .
here 's a <unk> , by the right light to the backside . you 've been looking at all of wikipedia , the greatest on wiki the world .
the largest wiki the world , who are 80,000 number is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft the web and collected more than any other issue in each other a wiki the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so there are four special powers , the into one end result of gamers are <unk> , hopeful way of individuals .
there are people who believe that you as a single change the world .
and the only problem is , they say , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the issue that i 'm going to solve four attempts .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he looked at why people kind of time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 'll account of nothing less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he goes ...
not just as i -- i think of games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that makes you in the sense , because the player can in <unk> achieve more than in real life .
you can in games holds social bonds , form as in real life . they get more and fools the rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently , perfectly reasonable that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree , first time , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to the real world in a game to turn .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years of shared .
there is , ancient game , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic controllers , there was <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek mockery <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about how , and why games invented .
according <unk> into action games , specifically , <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine is fabricated .
we think there was such a great famine , that the king of <unk> up to a crazy idea that decision .
the people who suffered . people struggling .
it was an extraordinary education . you took an extraordinary way .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a nationwide policy . in one day would you eat . next day would you play .
and they were much in the <unk> figure out to be there play , so fascinating is , and us to satisfying to <unk> productivity , surrounded by that you remember that would that 's nothing to eat it was .
and then , the next day would you play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> they survive as 18 years of famine , putting it in one day eating and the next was playing .
likewise , i think , we use today i play a .
we 're playing a to the suffering from the real world to escape .
we 're playing a to all due to avoid that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life , not distant unrelated other is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but does n't have the end .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> been by 18 years of famine is not better . so i decided to the king , one last <unk> scale-up .
they shared the realm into two camps .
they played a <unk> and the winner allowed to a <unk> adventure , it undo .
they were leaving <unk> and went on the lookout for a new home . they were just so many people back , how it food to survive , and we picked about the rest for an area , where they are able to .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> showing that the <unk> , the later this one roman empire , created this , the same dna as the old <unk> call them .
so then the scientists recently to the notion that <unk> . '' this crazy story actually true .
and we geologists thought that evidence of global cooling , the almost 20 years has persisted , what the famine explain .
so i could take these crazy story to vote .
you might have actually their people through the same ones saved by making them 18 years in games , escaped have and then this intuition , and so much about this playing with each learned that it makes the whole civilization for saving .
so , that we can also .
we 're playing , since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they played together 18 years <unk> , we 're playing with 16 years of warcraft .
i think we 're ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of your civilization in the lookout for a new world . so suppose i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we need to the aarhus convention , that half of us an hour 's a day with hanging , until we problems in the real world have solved .
i know , they 're going to ask , `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in games ? '' and that particular question i 've my work in the last decade at the center for the future chance .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it push out how we the future to understand them .
we do n't try to the future , prior to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want us the best results , imagine . and then to get people powerful , this performance in the real action .
we ask ourselves in epic victories of years ago , and give people who are out , you to achieve .
i show you very quickly , three games that i 've designed to try to people that epic victories of their own future to give you .
this is the world without oil . ''
this game is by 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you a <unk> overcome .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so for them , realistic it 's and they 're real life in fact , without oil life . so , if you to play and register , you tell us , where you live . and then gives you <unk> in real , the to show how much oil costs , what does n't exist , as supply , at risk is , as moving at risk is , whether school closed are , whether it was rioting . there and you to figure out how they 're real life make , if it 's true if it . and we ask about this blog , and videos or pictures of force .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the past three years traveling .
and i can tell you , it was a change the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , because we should .
but if you in a <unk> adventures are and told you get , `` let 's the oil out . ''
this is a surprising new adventures , on that you go .
they find out , how they had to go . most of gamers have been the game that learning habits and maintained .
so we 're looking for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher purpose put them than just <unk> .
we have this game `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of a <unk> that the people 's 23 years of the planet left would have .
this supercomputer that 's called `` global <unk> <unk> '' of course .
the call to players , are occurring sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it 's `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and all together , they can save the world .
but in our basketball game , instead of only five million people , we 're saying , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 players play the game 's eight weeks for .
they were 500 incredibly creative solutions that you read them , if you know , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game to take on three . march from it . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you this game , close to get them from the world bank , the distinction , social <unk> '' to end by 2010 .
we 're working on the universities all across sub-saharan africa , and i invite you , social reshaping , to learn .
we have a comic strip that . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ceaseless energy .
i want you all invited to this game with young people to share , over the world , especially in <unk> , most of benefits , together and their own social enterprises , to imagine , the world to save .
i come to the end .
i want you some questions .
what , you think happens when the next ?
we 've all those fantastic player , we have games that us to know what we can do , but we have the real world right now saved .
well , i hope that you say it some agree that i think that human resources are that we to work in real life can use , and that play a great significance to change we have .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social networks to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i hope actually , that we put together in history play games to this planet 's another century to survive .
and i hope that they 're going to me like to design and play .
if i go into the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things not sure , that we have every <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let the <unk> games are beginning !
thanks .
i 'd like to show something to talk about what i was a few months at writing an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i 've done on writing more and my <unk> fingertips , but i was with the process of this jar-shaped sign ever done , and i fell on that i 've ever been in my life <unk> have , what the word `` the disabled , '' -- which means .
i read them the post .

<unk> : well , strong , powerful . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and i had first of laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was only way , beaten up '' and i could no longer <unk> , and had to stop to read and i 'll just collecting data in this <unk> <unk> and the order <unk> emotional shock .
now , i was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 'm just thought that the issue some pretty be old man has .
but actually it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i 'm working with the school actually started and so i started , my self outside of circle competition to build and to shape , even in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i did n't <unk> used .
i 'd like this post it seriously consider , i would get into the world was born , that someone like me as a person will perceive their dignity , whose lives in <unk> very positive that run away . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , the i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i 'm looking at once <unk> of 2009 called , and expect that i 'm a <unk> contribution to think .
this is , updating version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
specifically to shake me the last two words in the near <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` well .
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about the people think that we do with these words to describe .
it 's about the values , the inside these words pop , and how we those values and the engine .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world , and people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the sounds , one <unk> a great force has , because that which you hear <unk> , there are also can manifest .
so , what we want to actually manifest themselves -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to say , could be enough , you to limit me and you have performances <unk> .
it would n't fun to give the doors to embrace ?
a person , the for me the door opened up , was my pediatrician in <unk> . and dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he says , dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can imagine , most americans ; cc : tell you could . so he was always dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful , fly and was for the work with kids , just like created .
i thought this time that i do in that hospital , i spent , just great -- the way on my <unk> .
i had some of activities that seems that infinite previous times over again with these big fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> building . and i have this to cut more vilified as anything else . i 've they hated it . i have you 're haunted . i 've they hated it .
and think of years ago , i whistled even when <unk> child with dr. p. negotiate and so i tried to these systems to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day he gave me at one of my favorite exercises that i 've seen -- these systems were n't really tiring and -- mercilessly -- and he told me , `` wow , which is aimee , you 're like a great , powerful and young girl , you 'll someday , one of the ligament organs .
and if you think highly talented , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just a lot easier to move from dr. twain , so i 've been practiced making that i do n't do n't want to the prospect that the richest five-year-old kid in the ward in the second third floor to be . but he got me , actually led to my daily <unk> using new eyes to see . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , how much of his vision of me as strong and powerful young girl with my self be shaped by and i 'm so imagine that was able to me as one of nature of the strong , powerful and <unk> person to see .
this is just an example among many , as adults in <unk> the imagination a child , you maintain .

our language behind the social change after that in many shining through a technology changes , generated .
from a lot of view from outer layer can course , you say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan , full replacements of our aging body , who would allow people , really all their opportunities to use and over the borders who you your natural what happens to set up , in addition to develop , not to talk about social <unk> platforms , people had to own identity , again , their own way , and so much define , and up with the world to groups to orient to yourself , pick .
maybe it gets so these technological change and clear , because according to think it always a different truth gave , which is that person has its community something <unk> and very powerful that can give and that the human ability to be re-adapted , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to be -- that 's an interesting story , because people i kept going to ask , to tell , like me with tremendous odds deal , and i 'm going to a confession , that sentence up to me , never <unk> and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions being able to answer , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
that sentence by people interact with tremendous odds that lives of the idea that success or fortunately it depends , a challenge to solving , without these things from this together can experience is shaped to be . as though my life so successful gon na be , because i the potential mind of life with a prosthetic limb of the way could , or anyway , people told me with my disability to perceive .
but the truth is that we change . so we are from the challenge was coined , whether you physically , emotionally , maybe two is
and i think that 's good .
tremendous odds are not an obstacle , that we <unk> need to deal with our lives better clear to come .
tremendous odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to odds , as my shadow , to see .
sometimes even realizing i that would look at your mind is , sometimes it 's hard to see , but he 's time with me .
and i mean , save the impact level of the severe head of <unk> one of people to be degrading .
there in your odds , and challenges , and they are just <unk> real and each person walks with it differently about . but the question is not , if we have tremendous odds are coming , or not , but how we make sure .
so we 're not just responsible for , the people we love , before <unk> to keep , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we could do our children 's no one level , if you feel that giving , they do n't fit together .
you have two things are dividing , one of medical fact , amputee , to be and the other the societal argument about , if i disabled , or not .
and in order to be honest , the only real and have an disability , with the i agree to set out in which is that the world every time , says , she walked me with definitions that describe .
in our desire , the people to protect , the us on the heart moving and you the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction , someone , or even a prediction for quality to ask , you are expected , we need to pay attention , that we 're not the ground for it 's mind , that somebody actually moving and is .
maybe it 's the buzz of the idea which just to pay attention , what 's in a crash is , and how do we fix , for each one more of disability than the pathology labs in itself .
if we have people do n't holistically and treat , and not all its power and opportunities to pick up to acknowledge , we make in addition to the natural struggle , the you might lead to have to another disease .
we <unk> a man , the for our society , a value is .
so we have over the <unk> look out and look at all sorts of human ability to focus .
most important , but this is that it between the perception of our mismatch , and our great human ingenuity , a connection there .


and maybe we make it , the odds , as something natural , coherent and useful to see , and ourselves in the way through their presence of work like this load .
this year and celebration , we put 200 . anniversary of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my view , on something very true in the human nature and pointed out .
i would it 's how to paraphrase `` not the powerful its kind of survivor , and also not the <unk> its way , but the off to the changes that 's best fit can .
of conflict is creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and the blossoming of the battle of human mind , marmite is , it 's a conflict to turn us .
so , again , change and adjusting these are the great skills of people .
and maybe we know , first , from which one of wood and we pinched it 's , if we really codes will .
maybe this is that 's exactly the point of tremendous odds , a sense of the troubles , a sense of our own power .
we ca n't know , even a gift .
we can be adversities , a new meaning to be , over the tough times beyond the line .
if we can odds , when you see the change .
tremendous odds are for a change , at the we have n't have adapted .
i think , the biggest neurological damage that we are caused by which is to believe that we normally should be .
let 's face -- who is normal ?
there is not normal .
there 's the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , the gray , who really know going to learn , if they really convinced that ?
i think more .
it would love , if we have this paradigm of normality , another the capabilities or the strength to use it 's even a little bit dangerous to ask , exchange can . so we can the forces of a lot of kids putting into , and they get invited to their very special , and precious and skills in the society itself .
<unk> 've found that we humans from the members of our society continues to be one of being challenged any time , useful to be and a contribution to do .
there are signs of going to come on the neanderthals , about 60,000 years older people and people with severe feeling of injuries , with the globe went and they did so maybe , because the wisdom in <unk> these people for the society value was .
they have these people not being broken and useless to look at ; they were as something special , and valuable , treated .
on a few years , i went around the city , where i grew up was , in a <unk> in that `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there with a <unk> tomato .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> on .
and i hear , as a guy behind me say , `` well , if that 's not aimee mullins , is . ''
and i turn myself down and i see those old man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , you know that we ? i ca n't get you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they appear to be hard to me remind .
when i do first saw , i was her from the belly of her mother has taken . ''
oh , so the .
and obviously has it , but then they click .
this is dr. <unk> , a man , the i just made narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , very characteristic , to my birthday , two weeks , too late to come .
the doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was on holiday , and so we knew my parents of the man , the me to the world , did , all .
and because i did n't <unk> was born , and my feet up after them pointing out there was and i just some toes in and a couple of your toes , the other foot felt it was the <unk> , these strangers to the bad news was a spectacular .
he told me , `` i had to your parents say that you never get the question , and never got more flexible , your instinct is how other children or that you never an independent life leads could talk , and since they broke me simply lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , collected -- he said , no matter whether i feel for a <unk> in the second grade , i 'd won , if i had the <unk> at the mermaid parade , to <unk> out there was , no matter whether i my transplant fellowship , or a lot of cups victories <unk> had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he mentioned that part of his <unk> the x is a factor , the potential of willing .
you ca n't enough to point out how critical supplies of a factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> told them , he said , `` i 've learned that children , if you do n't always something else said , and even if you just a bit of support , if you 're taught himself the leaves , then you can be very much better . ''
now , dr. <unk> has been thinking about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone in order to use it , two different things are .

i wanted to the then finally reach normal way .
you i 'm going to ask , i 'm not quite sure .
and this is happening , because i think about my legs , you 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change also happen , because i so many people running out here , the my door opened have , instead of people to meet , the me to cut up , i 'm an idea of mechanistic wanted .
now , it takes a really only person who you store , how their powers that manifest can , and they 're a way .
if you put them structurally possible , his own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you it eventually , and for people in a critical moment a door opened , then they 're for those people a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves , and doors to open .
the real significance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> .
it means to bring that in one is , the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential to do we then , access ?
in the '60s and had been in britain 's a <unk> done . now we were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call this , `` a tracking .
the students going to the grades .
and the the a student will <unk> more massive research ethics , get the better teacher , etc .
they 've got over a <unk> period of students with a `` well enough , '' the note , very good '' there . they were saying , they were <unk> that you very clever would be . and after these three months , they really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> it 's the heart to hear that way around the <unk> been said , they were just enough .
and likewise , it was then after the three months .
but who still in school were -- apart from the students as the school <unk> had .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo <unk> were .
the teachers who did n't know that something changed was .
they were just said , we are the student and that are the students with the note how complete . and likewise they have you something about teaching and turn them .
the only really at disability is a broken your mind a spirit , the broken down , has no hope . he found nothing more beautiful . he 's missing in our natural , childhood curiosity . and our innate capacity to the sights .
if we do it does n't make the human spirit of being able to support to continue to hope for themselves , and people around you to find , inquisitive and <unk> to be then we use our power is really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities that does , we can be a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to a poem end , that inspired by persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written and she turned off my friend , jacques <unk> told them . and this is `` the god , the only four words , if you know . '' `` every child knows that god , not the god the name , not the god is banned , but the god , the only four words , if you know , and the time again , he says all : come to dance with me . ''
eh , dance with me . thank you .
