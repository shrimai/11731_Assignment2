yes , afternoon , i mean , ladies , my gentlemen .
well thank you for the invitation , here today to speak .
and i have to me , right now reflects an idea .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , even odder term , <unk> at the city of food .
this is called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is one : computing , two , the organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and you know how to do n't be admired .
i know .
and beyond this , and this is something what my son , especially cut down , i am <unk> .
this means i 'm the head of the <unk> pole .
<unk> <unk> and five hundred <unk> .
and you have i 'm thinking , is obviously a subject matter , but when i do today <unk> want .
because with the theme of selectmen , because again , it belongs to the north pole .
we hope for the best and prepare ourselves on the worst of years ago , this is jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i start to do n't quite so serious enough to say .
i <unk> you a position .
how we talk , if it sort of a risk is that we just before a catastrophe would stand for example , <unk> perpendicular to rush .
many people are traveling .
it is pushing up , it <unk> up .
and somewhere on the edge of that 's a suitcase , lonely , leaving , something <unk> , maybe the military towers with you may .
nobody seems to get to belong .
the suitcase in is no .
suddenly an announcement .
and leave you that <unk> .
police comes to fire department , <unk> .
people scream .
officials , of honking .
get outside .
what 's because this ? to ask passersby .
we know that 's also not or we ca n't say .
the people leave the building .
i would be crying .
some of falling , maybe even , because it all very quickly go to .
a sudden , gossip .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is breaking out .
i hear now here on .
the rest kick me your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> have . <unk> ?
this is what was in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase can be gone .
later turned out that only , in <unk> , nine thousand pounds of crack in there were .
but people were just like , and that 's a friend mine that tells , from the building , forced .
it was n't say .
and it did exactly this gossip were suddenly , at least in the group at that my friend in my friend who was work .
thank god is n't panic for free , could it was n't always like that lies in theater as it seems .
you see , in a <unk> , one in encroaching the earth 's communication in a very important thing .
communication is so important because people in this situation is literally for communications <unk> .
they want to know what 's in los angeles .
once in the good , old it was for the authorities , quite simple .
we 've just ca n't have said , or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> was .
you up with this fair to say , god , the workers are in panic , because we say , rather than the truth or we say they can tell untruths .
this is in a time of social media , in an age of twitter , in an age of facebook , in an age of private and public satellite broadcasters , in an age of <unk> and public television may not possible .
simple and emotional , therefore , because it first is not be moral , and second is mostly anyway , we the past when the agency , the about what happened to report .
you may recall one of the passenger in the hudson river , if it 's a year in time ago .
the first reporting on this came on twitter .
someone who 's on a ferry crossing did , and rise and emotional behavior and tweeting out here 's an airplane <unk> and we save the people now .
this was n't <unk> .
you see , we 're dependent on , today , the rise and emotional experience of the first place , the truth to say , and very modifications to inform .
because most of course we also the past , the charges of the truth will know , because we as the agency have to make sure enough attention , that we just <unk> information to pass .
it 's public media , or any private media , or not so imagine or they 're just not .
of so , we 're going into food , and this goes something that 's ever been through the media is gone bust , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we going to the good old siren , the greatness .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
this means we 're going to the next few years about a hundred siren , where <unk> build that , some of you know that again , <unk> , if it is used to <unk> coming .
things used to it .
you may know you know yet , what 's three times stronger near , a moment , once a long by moment is that means .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to this today -- linking up with all <unk> that we this is where we 've got , <unk> , on facebook , on twitter , over the radio <unk> too late night , over the tv and all over the internet and the local media and so forth and immediately , in bandages of course , with <unk> to end of information forward to get .
and we know , we have been very quickly as making modifications to operate and we have been very quickly as making modifications , inform them , because the <unk> and citizens to be otherwise <unk> .
and we finally did n't even think that , which we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the earth 's so one hand , a question of the rapidity of all media , the us to apply to , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion , once again , turns out there is not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's anything worse than it 's actually .
we have therefore , too bad experiences has done with facebook and twitter , more recently .
well that you have some of with the media taken .
we have a <unk> into food <unk> man .
and it off a chemical bomb .
this is bombs up with a <unk> photos are , because there are supposed to start not at the first ue : on the <unk> explode , it by buildings in war ii <unk> and just at the ground , because of a chemically function , who was caused by having a plate , the popular <unk> two <unk> of another and separated , that are <unk> , and then it came to blast .
this problem is just a lot of these suitcase bombs were never works and they 're looking like ago in <unk> among them into food <unk> .
and there were we see an elderly gentleman , the be a conscience , how he so beautiful in the scientific protocol , i said , chiefly wanted , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three like it 's and now <unk> he 's the authority over to be misinformed , that there 's a bomb , the amount of laughter throughout the background .
the way since the world are several elderly gentleman reported in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see what we 'll find everything .
these suitcase bombs to go on site , not have defused the will , but has blown them .
and so we 've got in <unk> the rise and intense an , in every sense of the word , a bomb , exploding .
and the first in history of town , the whole to come on facebook and twitter , going to give up with the consequence that the entire <unk> far above <unk> <unk> up following are .
and the media was thrilled . laughter in the background .
we had n't even with the phone , but they did a <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
it had a great effect for us , because the credibility that 's significant level of these social media .
just so , they have to me any sign of giving , when i went to .
i can go from here 's not at the clock , looking .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media , the advantage of them to be very much information to pass .
not so <unk> are , because the members of there are tweeting right the <unk> , how she calls , a high <unk> have .
secondly , early corrections .
if anything not true , writes that as someone who immediately , so the soundness of the i just talked to significantly increase , because i saw the entire community in effect on the reports in this is .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything that 's wrong , then it can also very quickly <unk> .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , the most exciting to find , as a bomb on <unk> park in high line .
of so we 've made of those things that in the last happen is , and it 's very much more <unk> happens when <unk> an even think , as <unk> one knows .
well , the city may eat per day of such a disaster home and researching this .
a bomb , who has blown must be in a park , it 's certainly not such a .
but you can also , and even after this digging now , in <unk> to be found and then i am , we got working with our <unk> and try and the in seven feet <unk> .
and if the , you think in munich , you think about other cities , if the will implode must be , because they saw something called a <unk> has to take conventional or not to defuse that can , then we know already now , be a variety of houses that no longer than it looks like before .
and this to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it is happening in one in a world <unk> <unk> velocity is necessary to communicate to do to just a little freaked out to prevent us to take care to bear , people to be informed us to take care to carry that the people in are capable of , to these difficult situation to hire .
and the social media to help us also starting to be believable , to be because ultimately , they all of the communications are involved , and it 's not just a one-page <unk> is how we 've done in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly other thing in the <unk> for much did .

and <unk> this has been .
there 's on twitter and on facebook , a lot of help you walk , if we also partially destroys you 're trying to handle it was , because suddenly <unk> of people just started diking 're trying and you knew nothing more about where the <unk> are .
this shows , there 's still a lot to do , including the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented , solidarity with the <unk> and the region has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a conversation does n't even more way to think that are .

thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm right now you also starting to own type of <unk> to form .
what it is that there i <unk> are going to that i 'll ask you also a moment ago .
before i do that , let me , but some things <unk> .
the first is , which i believe that we really excited indeed to life needs .
that we 're telling stories that could live .
and i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories are , as of the entertainment business actually produced .
then i think again , that the internet , the infinite , yeah , by actually pretty much no <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> of confident that people that were created , to be creative .
and that you happier lives are , once you to be creative people can .
the more people are happy to be more than that 's the world .
and make logically .
these better world is now , however , just a byproduct .
in primarily i 'm talking about how we already said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to start looking at midnight , in a bar , in the very happy <unk> sung by step .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now she receive from the congratulated and the music that 's not so much with , because in the moment where it strikes midnight , has become , something happens with her .
it 's something happens in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and she did n't real word for it .
they do n't know what 's happening .
i 've even though that word for it .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one hand <unk> and toto runs through <unk> and everything is very white .
i ' and feel that i 'm sort <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand we have two people in the country of oz -- end up with very much color .
and it was this is where the first told that i 'd better <unk> and writing , when that i draw .
so the first of which <unk> now with their new perceptions that is something which is an alien man with <unk> <unk> hair , the ago , she says , you very serious look and saying , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> enlightens <unk> about to make a very special kind of people heard .
they started as <unk> born .
players are people who graduates from your <unk> 've reached about their lifetime to play .
who of you know <unk> ?
very beautiful .
think of years ago , the immortal , to this <unk> n't swords , if you stack together , but <unk> from the pocket .
so , dice <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really matters , the players have no insight into their what’s possible .
we know , nor do , when we die .
i believe that 's being a long life , but we know it does n't .
it could tomorrow also totally be over .
and therefore it 's in my players , too much .
you know nothing to much you should really can play .
that means , again , it has lost a minute perhaps the last been to be .
a gamer , of his entire lifetime , maybe playfulness is , <unk> in the moment of <unk> as a candle that <unk> will .
now we can be natural wonder : if that because this is dangerous , why games are then place ?
the answer is clearly , this .
without play , without any players create a space , <unk> , all of gray and only if some outstanding players play , he is actually alive .
they were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you go through the world of gamers <unk> , their first of challenges that turns out and of course , but turn into <unk> fall , this is the story that i tell you want .
and it changes in a <unk> .
the first slate has 12 , play , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens that i just too late i saw .
so , twelve follow in the first slate with a certain length of time , five or seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result , after the other , you <unk> told that you know it .
that television is doing everything from his <unk> anything else .
this is not news .
and if it all be , then play . ' i 'm one thing .
and also not here .
now it 's only the races .
we go again to <unk> back .
what 's the most famous sentence of the movie or from a series ?
it can only one of us , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that would .
and that indeed comes in my players actually not too .
where it can kind of cool .
there 's how many different games .
just think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth and so on .
and so just <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and therefore be here 's plenty of stories that all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is it , because all share ?
i '' somebody who have been quite fundamental to think of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficient smart and the most imaginative .
but i know that 's a hundred brain , no longer producing as the only thing , though it 's mine is .
so it came to directly to the idea that you the crowd , with their creative process <unk> .
what would be , if we <unk> not tolerate even enable , but even <unk> ?
so when we say , we invite you very very much a , the development of this <unk> to address .
think of years ago , for example , in the number three appeared in a <unk> on that they really neat to find out because they do for example of her grandfather was reminded me .
moreover , they 're a huge fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , with the modern technology is that did n't even more so hard to a <unk> do .
and this lets them on the <unk> up , where it goes straight , and this is really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience , adding up .
i mean , it 's not anywhere among , but it goes into the right there , where it ends up to .
this really nice is that we in the internet .
and in the internet can you know , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of interactions .
this means you as viewers , you can write to draw , spin , whatever they want .
and if we 're also again this structure through .
this is <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up .
and i 'm really <unk> believe that , that the internet was born , in fact that kind of stories to tell .
it just doing does n't so many , specifically at : no one .
so , here you go , ' i but even one step further and i leave the viewer can find ourselves to the player .
because in a <unk> .
because you can reduce the characters from a series of force willing , but also for people in the real world , the ones that <unk> on your cellphone has .
deduce the disposal , the you know it may also all very well , are sort of the mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful giant who are very rapidly evolve .
and on the i do n't take away , because i would go back 20 minutes i would need .
we conceive of all together .
everybody 's time has made of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could pop the jury of , right now , i have that 's a cognitive function , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the me for the price for the greatest competitive business plan for giving .
and i need to say that jury was all of officials from the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so the common-sense definition of people to give me .
and if i want to convince you can , here with my : the internet right to use narrative structures to revolutionize , along with the world better , then i think , i can actually anyone to convince them .
so .
everybody 's time off , why is this whole , then , like ?
because just start in the names all sectors , covered .
we 've now in the first of the <unk> : who 's turn , my turn , you turn , and everybody 's time off .
and then that die .
in the series of getting very much died .
everybody 's time taking it means , everyone needs to die .
and then , obviously also , everybody 's time off in terms of everyone can participate , when he does n't want .
this is me really important .
i 'll get ' data from <unk> and there 's nothing worse , to me , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know whether they 've seen that .
if you in theater , who , and then it 's an actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh , i 'm not me .
and this is it right .
so it is voluntary organizations interact .
and nobody has .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason i german , speaking is that the entire project done in german will be , yeah .
this has some reasons .
i 'm looking at this project <unk> long road and i was kept asking : go to this , but in english , customers more , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that i can not just saying , the german <unk> is the third largest the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's spanish , and then the german .
now is not so , like we 're looking at any little niche move .
furthermore think i really quite clearly , if it also other people go like me that people to be grateful going to something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the end , then everybody <unk> and each of wordplay <unk> has been .
if all this case , like i wish i would , then goes the first result now on the first <unk> <unk> online .
and if you look forward to ask , why i , because now i 'm here in a <unk> , where it down below the headline <unk> worth , <unk> involved .
that i also some ideas .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also pretty sensitive to <unk> and <unk> .
some <unk> were also about two and <unk> .
and i can really just say that this whole thing incredibly important is , and an inspiring .
but it 's too much nothing , if you 're not flies .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just throw it took the , what i so i 've learned .
and it applied was .
and continue running that 's good .
i can really just say .
so , so whenever somebody who thinks , i 'd have been my bit contribute , i had 19 degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i have made of ai n't work <unk> cartoon , or whatever , that 's also have already been .
you find us already in the internet .
on facebook .
yep , as freely in the speaker was speaking .
yes , love ' i also .
welcome to : you can memories are wiping out ?
question for them .
you can memories are wiping out ?
you because at all remember , what in your life ever 's happened ?
they 've got <unk> remember that ?
who has who can even at all remind me ?
it 's not hands up .
so you memories are wiping out ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like that we want to get us today is n't do .
then it 's quite quickly .
again a good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk about tonight , the so i 've chosen , because he had two of my passions , or my two great love right now come together .
i ' dream up here in terms of computer , studied and it made of me just with the bits and of bytes and employed , the world today about how far from the world to fly .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and mentor in the private and professional field hides his way .
on the one hand , i got so with the with the computer much more engaged , on the other hand , i 'm currently working in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one thing that the human ?
what about that change ?
the order to a comparison directly questioning .

so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can build a computer , the way that works like the human brain ?
so , and i believe that ' there we already quite close .
so i think of these two , three hundred years , no longer need that no longer .
but let me give you do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> bit of needs .
so the analogy between the computer on the one hand and our brain on the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based on the same thing , so your smartphone that their tablets , you <unk> and also these cameras , and all these smart refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he is the cpu , central <unk> unit .
this stuff is composed of little sooty transistors .
the word has probably everybody 's owned and in <unk> it will be such as a triangle of time .
this <unk> little device , that has three ports , and turn on this type of electricity across or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i did . '' this extra <unk> back about five hundred million of these little pieces .
and the turn around the heck of clutter .
we 're logging that stuff we 're allowed things , we have degrees ' room and albert einstein said , you hear , yes , 'n computer can all can be very much , very quickly , actually , and he can just zero and one in perspective .
more it can not .
he 's actually quite it sucks .
we want it 's compare with our brains .
our brains have a more than the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , there too , i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter up here in .
this beautiful but is , our your neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but who have to <unk> each neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
that 's tens of 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see on the complexity of the brain is to make a few times higher than that which we point when computers have .
we want to the <unk> let loose , maybe the one or any of , the first supercomputer that had their own power station side facing , ha , the cluster , and with the control the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .

and of course , and this is one of the equivalent of two big selling bananas , so much more and you do n't and you your calculators up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> freaking good part up here , <unk> a giant high calculator with <unk> , why we 're using the next was n't , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe if you know the or another kind of ads in the internet , like the human nature uses only 10 percent of his brain , buy it now this <unk> order to <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> go wrong spot on the advertising a little .
ten percent , yes , perhaps , but our brain is yes , throughout our evolution to that crowd grew that , yes <unk> smaller , in the middle of yet our <unk> with his liver , everything else has <unk> building .
that 's probably not to happen because we do n't use .
why it seems like this is that we the most of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know the notion of <unk> ?
of i compared ' worth of course , so nice to the iceberg , if you the iceberg see , in the sea , then is nothin ' ] so the top , there 's the ocean , bottom of it 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , this is that 's about that which our ] , our job of mind is , <unk> goes well , nine-tenths of which runs a huge <unk> off , <unk> .
we <unk> the point we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and to give <unk> on this memory to revisiting them , maybe if you know the or another human beings with <unk> memory .
people who spontaneously on a lot more detail it can remember when i do n't got 'em . '' in the situation <unk> , and the story was then <unk> , i ' said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
this is , there 's very , it 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone who <unk> , somebody 's mostly in a field <unk> , the excellent is , who has a very good <unk> memory , who 's been in an airplane , and screwing up in an airplane , in a helicopter , so fast is , '' he then ow ' no , over rome effectively went , has to rome to view , yes , so rome that 's right now ow ' not necessarily the smallest one city , has been on a gigantic , signs of paper came and has started to rome to draw .
and it 's not a way , so here 's the river , and there is nothin ' that , no , every single house , every single door , every window , he once seen it , he <unk> , it could go back to put on paper .
how come from this ?
so why is the thing , why we ca n't that , well , the presumption , is perhaps pretty close to say that the <unk> bit more access to his nine-tenths of the craft .
now we 're using the well , but why can i 'm not at the at the <unk> last night , remember , in all things ?
'n a friend , <unk> of mine has some interesting things done .
he used for example , in the law enforcement work and has to a rape survivor who worked , who had her experience is completely eliminated , that was not our mind , that <unk> <unk> by the brain , that 's not going on this is gone .
well , that came the very clear .
now i went , but again , people <unk> to do .
there 's in it in a very safe session , at the end up after this event earlier features can , even if you do n't be more active can remind , she could then the hallmark of the car see where these people <unk> , that was n't <unk> , that was their 40s meters on .
and actually is with the hallmark of the perpetrators believe there was .
the second what i would be a great found that was , he has a lady in <unk> man who has been carrying that her mother , you used to alice in wonderland read it 's when she was little , so four years .
there was sitting up her lap , your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he does she said , in a trance , advice any time ago .
then she has begun to read , she was four , when they have that is , you could i did n't read , today can do this .
and then they said he said , tell me give the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland , found , where do on this side of text that said , the woman who read .
the brain has so this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
and then she could read .
so yes , we actually have access to it , but we seem to be in ordinary lives , say , we <unk> kind <unk> to have to look not to <unk> .
now , save , we did not what happened in itself , but how <unk> have said , he got one of a picture i saw , a , a a <unk> , we could save the fact that we have sensory experiences , so that which we see , it , what we smell , that , what we hear that , what we taste and that which we feel , hey , if you now <unk> at a yellow lemon thinking and how it 's really <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> sense , like the tastiest parts , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long evening , plunk yourself , but <unk> comfortable down , ha , <unk> bit upright and , then you can i asked them to leave you just give you very quickly , your eyes .
and you remember in a very experiences , positive that event in the recent past , yes .
take the first , what happens .
and , if you that 's going to let 's going to you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part of .
they get , maybe a picture , maybe as a movie ?
some kind of this is not only way , because we do n't that normally do , but we do you first realized .
and if you see that , then it may be that they 're either in the movie is , from their eyes , all experience , or as you see themselves on a screen .
this is , and we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , you can at the mind back to solve , we get the way back to start .
that 's because a visual information , one hand up ?
yes , there 's go down <unk> ' a few hands up , this is so , 'n two-thirds or so i 'd say , yes , that 's about this , what i thought i 've , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it 's look at first moment , not notices .
well , make bees ' <unk> on .
<unk> whatever you is in your memories , if you memories <unk> , where it’s not just this memory in high , <unk> <unk> feeling that , we <unk> a positive that event , and i have made of the one or other babies smile can see , there was so yeah , it was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , and it 's the brain may still there , actually save , we do with memory be nice or other feelings that .
and now here 's what 's exciting .
<unk> all been before , yes , well , of our brain power of the most important to any difference between what we actually reminded of and the , what we just imagine , what we have conceived .
well that you can test , if you look at home <unk> sit and it up in the future to imagine that 's not there 's happened , they 're similar information to do something , if you look at something to remember , what the past was .
and , which you know , but surely those stories that you look like that tells a situation round , of time .
now , hey , because this happen and that , and this was so beautiful , and ever more these stories behind , the more beautiful it will often the stories , hey , there were people still a lot of drunks , there was the evening , even more complex social situation , there was the sunset or even more romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we actually -- it on afterwards , to do , so if we really our memories so we change , why do we do that 's not alive , i asked them ?
<unk> , when i came to have my uncle , a picture , i showed of his hut and in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a beautiful shack .
just , this picture is nothin ' <unk> bit more beautiful than the shack , so it 's artistic quality of freedom , he told me explain , well , there 's the shack <unk> bit of generations , there is nothin ' 'n bit of grass all before , there 's a gorgeous dog , before , because it shines the sun at the alps , this is quite a picture of the shack , not to fight .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what it bothers me of the fact , when i that even more fun doing , at what i mean , who has been thinking ?
they 've actually an artistic quality of liberty in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know how some people who are you look at the morning , if you just like this gray have eyes , which is because this ?
yes . i 've ' at sex , i went around the <unk> through your head .
really all night and this idea of made me no longer matter .
i think it 's around the he made the idea does n't .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he went to germany , came , because his mother in <unk> remained , and he did you just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he has every night with her son would sit and he said , or has been wondering , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , and tell you know , and then he 'll tell me , this in <unk> now , this in just tell me , which is a brilliant 's happened .
and , within two weeks went away from the son , great .
and then there was also okay , that your momma way is that 's the back to visit .
and the now in the that 's at all the youth who made with those who is today one of <unk> people who i know .
so these are not the memories , the us to influence , in the way we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we think of waste , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that , today now ow , this is so , <unk> this practice . ' i but really not , then make it 's just like to do you know tom cruise to this <unk> fiction movies , he has this , that these <unk> computer where it -- files <unk> <unk> to do it , but also time , you look for their pictures that <unk> have about this , well , not all that this fabulous place i have to tell you , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happening now , bam , way that .
so ham , '' we because <unk> ' yet , ah , something beautiful , yes a distance ever since , <unk> , yes , that has to me <unk> ' real good , damn thing that was beautiful , okay ?
and then take that lay down off with .
they assume that with in your <unk> and let 's involved .
or if you know somebody <unk> bitter , <unk> , whether it <unk> their your boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , if you <unk> .
so , and take it again , the image , we put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let in the background horses jump , yes , they laugh , why are you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of thinking funny .
and you can be much better at the situation into interactions .
ca : man , memories so precise moment ?
no , i think our brains have much of the capacity to think it all be able to store .
it does n't matter , because we can release them , how much , we focus on and how we an event , a memory , an idea to rate , it comes up at us .
my plea on you , at them , they play with the images in your mind , they use the power of the unconscious and they give him every day <unk> to enrich your life .
yes , the good afternoon .
thanks for the invitation .

if i then <unk> , that it is the film festival by a film festival in classical music industry is , then we say it down before that tutor crowds , this picture of the old people who are now , long <unk> in <unk> clear these are , and very focused on the art , while listening .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and that wrong is the same thing also with what we do .
so they still a glimpse of what i 'm speaking , i put them a short film , brought .
film .
technology is <unk> 'n <unk> linking it .
this brings it from my perspective on the best on the point .
since <unk> growing the <unk> from the <unk> lust , something completely different to do .
we hobbyists are today is something between eighteen , and the middle , the bottom 20 old and i have very early in our youth who , which have tremendous force and delight us that classical music <unk> .
we 've also seen that the conventions of <unk> and of <unk> us there are joyful , well , a little spoiled it can .
and we are the confidence that 's called the crisis the classical music , not at the content , so on the music for yourself , but it on their <unk> lies .
so we think of the question , how do a <unk> create that the music , the near , the friends and these are -- again , there , the way that we 've so on her like .
how do a <unk> organize that beyond the conventions of <unk> work ?
we ask the parameters which they are coming from the standard , concert will know , space , time , light , the context , basically in the question .
consider for example of the relationship between the audience and musicians .
usually have between the stage and the first-year talk about a gap .
we 're trying to the inhibitory effect .
so this picture of our <unk> .
the musicians to sit in the audience , drink beer , entertain people into our breaks through listening to stand up to play a , two pieces , put into the audience .
it 's in the course of the evening , a little <unk> .
everybody , the notion that has <unk> , it depends on the stage and go back .
or that are sitting in the concert .
in the standard , concert does matter is that you look at any one of comfortable , permanent chairs , like you here , that’s seated and look forward , look , and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we thought done , what about this practice .
if you see ourselves to sit and look at a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , then hear them automatically degrade the way .
now comes up on us in the concert does n't a stage was safer , four stages in order for the audience around .
the audience could be yes <unk> .
so , sitting at night every once in the front row .
important for us is that we 're not only just any events are , but that we of the music from thinking .
we should be connected to ask , which are rooms and the atmospheres of a vague , but also in the minds of the human needs the music that way you look at how they are supposed to ?
and so then you get concerts by night around <unk> clock only 30 in <unk> , the s 's actually just by <unk> lit up , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around and the illumination can make music to life going to make up until now , but the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy , that we 've been a few years with <unk> work together , who inspire us the dances , or movement to music to <unk> flourish which does n't actually to dance been written about .
and so then you get <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> by steve the realm .
and this year we 've got , yes , if you will , <unk> complete .
we have the first a concert , along with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> together .
that 's all about too high image works , because we have a major <unk> had to us in this piece of aid .
we have a <unk> lot of people across all of germany would be harvested , so that we that existed in their use .
in there is this film festival something that from a community -- it arises .
we 're totally happy in terms of <unk> in the town <unk> a home and evolved to have .
the city because it 's exactly how big that we have been great spaces and exciting parts of dissonant concerts for figuring out , but also how small , that we notice us .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks forty <unk> from across europe in the city are , then drops on just that in the city , more people with <unk> walk as an otherwise .
this film festival is volunteering that organized .
we hobbyists are a want you mix of students and students , professionals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really care all mixed up .
and make a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in your eye , it keeps , <unk> be seven or 10 makers in a <unk> , the for a year for a compulsory tasks are picking .
although even started volunteering , but they may not care for a year that for example that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in solid hands are and to the film festival by organizing .
we 're doing that all in our private , and live in all of germany .
i mean , most of the work together in production and on a <unk> .
just three times , and then we 're thinking about this year that defuses into an extended weekend , brainstorming , they repeat the one or problems , the show are , and maintaining this is also interpersonal together , that just amazing is important , if you do something like in motion to keep .
the film festival , even come and twenty or 30 private voluntary organizations that , for a few days or a few weeks , your hands , promise and then there 's touch , where the way that 's needed to make <unk> , when <unk> , when <unk> , when <unk> .
and clearly in that 's 14 days from the musicians that .
now , you might think that would you do anything you for such a film festival in need .
but our <unk> goes deeper .
we 've been in <unk> in the city a large community around us to build a sort of us support of on what we want to do .
that comes from the classic <unk> go , and that 's also about the very practical things like for example , the board , because we have a baker , of us about bread <unk> or a <unk> , of us , fresh food is open to make them .
this <unk> going into a barnes in the city where all over the entire year , back and sells .
down to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole range from private space found that we 're living room to provide , with the musicians would have no samples .
and that way , and it 's the film festival , to something we give in this city has grown up from the people in this city .
they relate to be quite a particular kind and engage with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we could you <unk> support from the citizens on a <unk> , where we call that 's the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable <unk> , put them .
now makers in the stage , believe that classical music rock'n -- which provided you come in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly deeply happy about that throughout europe young musicians played music in their own hold back home with yourself in the cities <unk> this right .
if you 're still not so i 've been able to imagine , how does it feels , classical music is how to experience , then they come up just over .
but starting next year we 're back in <unk> and we would look forward , if you then there are .
yes , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you think it may know him .
you heard about to learn , or the effect of education , but i mean , to learn it was a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know , even experience once <unk> , a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
what i think of art and culture , i 've learned , well , because i can not a lot of course , to say , because gps . ar <unk> <unk> i mean , in this field .
and why i 'm thinking that it might be right now , this thing <unk> called a different selects just giving them , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , does n't work .
they 've been laughed .
you get over the laughter , though most of the phrase usually happens .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word you something <unk> , what we do n't really capture .
art , say that we even sometimes , that 's what .
to work as we say this rare , that 's what .
even sometimes .
people who likes to work , that 's what to me .
but at work , we think more in the <unk> and at the arts kind of the rich , most of everyday life , where we look in moving , our experience points , our own thoughts .
and so i mean <unk> that i 'm now i memorized it wants , in about three hours in five different sections of a divided that all the title , have to do with a i of the beginning , so for you very simple is .
it starts with the <unk> , for the child , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , going to go further , the word <unk> let me afterwards , why i do for my <unk> i took .
the interaction of the first of my professional life and finally , fifth , positive identification .
<unk> one chimp is this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian 's bach , know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , if you 're fashion , practicing , and i 've got fashion , practicing .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little bits and play , on the piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a melody and play and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is equal , but it 's <unk> .
and that , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in the art that it really succeeds , and if it only two votes are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , sometimes is , in art , images , in <unk> , in your plays , the things that <unk> are , in the moment to put together , the art makes us .
and i have when they 've learned , two distinct melodies , i mean , three , at the <unk> <unk> , the same time to play , any kind of , but to hear , the way to illustrate that wo n't .
this was , what i mean , you 've learned , among other .
another experience i 've never forget and i have the concern , i suppose that i have today may be there 's how could .
i have the piano <unk> , they were more people in the hall over here today , and in the middle <unk> i came out .
i did n't forget .
i memorized it was playing .
so again over again -- and at the same spot , i had never again on it .
this audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went to its calm down my place , i brought my notes , put them down and when the third time over again .
and they do n't know how to me <unk> do afterwards .
but this was a very tough experience .
perhaps that was also one of experiences , where i 'll know , well , with the piano , although i 'll quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my career move , because to talk , we can be easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean overridden by the inspiration and there too , i want to tell stories .
when i like this <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather than a gentleman <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that wo n't .
because you have plenty of coffee houses , we went out and a lot of experience with women raised all have .
now think of the time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , such a sentence .
the i certainly not forget .
and on from there , i set of course , more , practicing .
now i was the way down and to time in a <unk> .
i 've practiced , and i remember in a situation that i do n't know , no longer have experienced .

i can run it does n't just play , is not a piano , here , and i could do n't .
i have this point two decades , 30 times a row , and play and suddenly , she 's right .
and then i did she kept playing and <unk> , i was into complete ecstasy and play , and i know , just that i suddenly on ground quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to drink , not taken , and the music has done with me that 's done .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotion is also really allow us .

where all of themselves involved .
we had this situation in fact , but then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we are <unk> did , has the only half months taken , where we usually a half years for would need .
well that were my experiences with the piano , with the art , yes , with the artistic quality work .
and now i get to my student , <unk> .
i was first time when musicians out , but as <unk> .
we have <unk> played , <unk> , <unk> .
i 've <unk> given , and i am living there 's quite next to my <unk> for the music moved to re-engage them and that <unk> man .
in the choir of music , common to breathe , a <unk> singing , wonderful experience that i 'm very , etc. , enlighten , have .

because the art , culture to happen , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but not as artists , but , otherwise would you did n't say <unk> , but rather than <unk> <unk> and continue to be done .
i was there in theater and i am <unk> , there was in germany would n't have a degree program for <unk> , just in vienna , there i am i did , and on from there , i got more and that question as we 're preoccupied , what we can do to art to allow us to the framework for art to improve them to use a management , a good state building ?
and that was the reason that i 'll also had stood 'm in my career , its way that <unk> , and with <unk> years before i know , and then <unk> .
but before that was another <unk> , and this phase i mean overridden by interaction .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> , it comes <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in <unk> there was , and says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about peeves -- i , i have this kind of time <unk> .
but i 've got a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale firsthand .
this was my prior to do something which i 'm not quite enjoyed actually , and suddenly i would get sucked into another form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , who lived by people in this in bureaucratic school , this device of <unk> .
once the carnivale on us coming to be all in a very different position , in different states .
and i started with <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , of my friend and colleague who was , since then we have always gray to <unk> christmas music making , he had guitar , i piano , yet another one has a bass -- played , for example , i could go back to memorize <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but obviously in the lyrics of <unk> <unk> , months and practicing .
and this carnivale , what we got really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i look at nine , november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't begin with that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yes .
i am more quickly respond to be ready , at any questions for <unk> .
and down there , i was a trustee of the cities in germany .
and i 've got back and seeing how to interact as casual interaction be one of the german culture .
actually what are the same language , the music is they too fine , and was wonderful and play , but i forget that was <unk> , <unk> .
different from the carnivale it came to do n't of the people all the brain , but it was a lot of the top , and i did as a big enrichment , it felt , here to experience , like the german identity , it brings me afterwards , once again , you back to come slowly trajectory completely broken up and the german <unk> then these two states , bringing them .
since is germany , yes <unk> .
since is also on the federal much more <unk> , places .
interaction , i started , but in front of all things here taught me and experienced , in the city of food .
we have of the first thing i had actually a <unk> , think that time ago , when i 'm here we started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i have the other .
and play stood for <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was the first of the manager of <unk> .
so i play is not much so , anyway , this was wonderfully well that i these <unk> had , but she disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge , and make alliances , for education do and shape could .
we have a lot of the urban studies done , we have the what if it 's , that the analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see what we 'll be designed to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between art and architecture see that we can , from <unk> to <unk> at the blue and stones .
many , casual interaction , we could and i could create , and i 've experienced , and they noted , what this , when multiple people from different areas combined a target to track .
they memorize the way that i ever more <unk> of the art , more to culture , the us what makes us , the us the scientific unifying between humans , between cultures , between community , should say , in the eyes to take and i come , but later on the art .
interaction were also go between the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea was , the explosion , january <unk> , that <unk> could walk around the <unk> europe and the promotion paths .
but that last chapter , this one fifth one chapter one has yet the title of identification .
this word has the two senses , one , i 'm a misimpression by me with something , <unk> 'm going to something , and i can also as verb , use and say , i 'm a misimpression by something which means , i know something .
and it 's always in his quirks .
i know anything with his quirks and , so i say , i 'm a misimpression you or the or that community .
and i 'm a misimpression by me with something , when i 'm going on <unk> and say , that belongs to me , but when i want to identify .
and that 's a very big campaign had .
five decimal point three million people to try to move , <unk> cities , up to identify the double coupons and so , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of a lot of people that in a big <unk> life and yet at least a common language to speak , though <unk> nations are and this was our cognitive function , the positive identification , to start with the people and of them all of course , too much the ride .
if you see signs , at the <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> did n't have so many people noticed .
so ham 's <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , working , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and young kids come from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letter of people , young men , from <unk> to a play in processing , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last letter writing .

and then set out of these young men on the piano , and played this <unk> that i so loved .
and at oh , then i quoted him from a letter , and said , i 'm a pianist , he wrote him at home , as young german , the he used , and i ca n't have a <unk> play , because my my two fingers exactly <unk> are .
and he <unk> his finger at an <unk> , sat down to put her piano in a play on <unk> carl , and tried to the <unk> to play .
and it could n't .
it was for me like a touching the shot , that i look forward , jumped out here , have said , what we 've actually learn ?
we 've learned that in the <unk> that many people together to move anything can , but in front of all things we 've learned that we sixties years in <unk> in peace of life and the culture of us that connects us to make no longer the minds go , because we different languages both talking to think we can relate to identify which gives us that belonged to feel .
and it was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's when you learn not just about something to know .
it 's when you learn more about something to learn and <unk> to win .
and we 're pretty much different and invention of loose , <unk> , if we let it , that we spark off of art and culture of our own right position to relate , in a dialog with the artwork , if we interact and finally , even in our own identity , keep working to make us with art and culture to question now , then we all share
and i hope that they still a lot <unk> and <unk> have , of things that they 're winning the city .
thank you .
yes , thanks .
i think we wait on the first picture while ago .
so i have to <unk> support for my memory there 's a few slides <unk> .
it 's but no scientific slides , but it comes in my <unk> here 's why , a way to find and i do with a theme of engaging , where i think that gets us the next few years to significantly to deal .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you something that ted 's also means , and i think , in terms <unk> we can this talk is quite arbitrary .
and then i had never heard that you to talk , in english , how would be , if somehow it possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand , what i in english , trying to say , i knew i 'm not directly , like i say , to me and so i have to talk , then , but in german , calm .
how we 're going to die .
i have this to you start by <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , where i the <unk> <unk> , and was down .
she was about , nine-tenths of years old and has always liked the may , dance , because it 's also on her husband , i remember , of the first man who in war like it was then .
and so it 's of every year for the first of may to dance ; i went and has been to dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> too much a drink , and then is down and has , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg is broken , the <unk> .
a few years before she was done before , down and came up on the same way , about the same event , before the left leg is cracked .
and then i had been there a physician and i 've experienced , as you weeks , in the intensive , was , as you to antibiotics that was treated , well , resurrects itself was , and i have the discussion of service , as i was , is because that any sense ?
it makes any sense , and to a much older people are more intense an industrial process to use to express ?
so speaking , to <unk> , on the intensive care for weeks , it is a human beings ever <unk> ?
and it 's got a fixed way .
five years later i get into the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the can i 'll notice , because he just so rare is , also for the time that time , and he said , they danced in the may turn on the other one leg is cracked .
this is the question , what <unk> i could actually , when i talk , like a human to be deciding what is , what he was in his directives into , or what he also about <unk> fills you ?
and it 's a bit about the subject of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> of the name , how we 're going to die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to a report on the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization are very much everything we went out , so you 're wondering , he said , how it 's going to be connected to work ?
you have and then , and that can be in this book again today is n't read , just said , it 's a quality of all , so the pieces , always go together .
it 's a network of labor to take place it will also work even more deeply and overseas to be for example , after china , this was a big .
and this is also how did that basically the work of individuals , so something physical , something that technology , increasingly less <unk> was that would ever stronger control it was kind of the quality of it delivers that , of the accuracy .
and that , after my appreciation , the people saw in the more confidence from their jobs may be able , and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was never about , maximizing the sky high <unk> to reach , and no longer why , through his work being able to define .
and if we do now carry on the <unk> and medical field , then there 's obviously just like a trend .
if you on even hear , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> most toxic mix , then it 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there has documented by which you did , so we <unk> is , so we ever paid for animals , and if not going to document is , and says the health services used as well , that care or that medical treatment for we do n't .
and through that large documentation , but the work <unk> ever stronger <unk> and more and capture this idea that you see his work , fulfilling and to use of personal belief compound , the background on such a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a great friend of me is now in holland , then , because he said this is no longer trying to the had a <unk> practice , has been abandoned and it 's in holland , i went to the doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> 're on these development normally given a piece of streamlining , and he , the martin , had just saw first-hand experience that more old people swing between a nursing , the hospital , and go back , because the <unk> could n't know , what they should do , if it 's the people are worse and left .
then come into the hospital , will have restored to go back in my senior home , or a nursing , and get there continues to care .
and this physician was just imagine being considered when it 's more structured at the netherlands , there , then i want to be like to train , me to something here to promote that you from this cascade of <unk> and of the same <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , well , in the netherlands is arrived , he did n't end to find that , after he the language of much harder time learning that had learned that 's where the same thing happens to do with this <unk> happened .
it will also with dying , increasingly a quality was introduced .
it 's no longer the credibility that counts , but you put even in an available to find , i want for example , no problems are , or not the hospital , when i in a nursing my own .
and then that will be honored .
in holland , it 's so , on the third day or find a conversation with the admitted , instead , and they have to go to settle , i want to the hospital or i want to work in the hospital , when i could happen .
so just with , i want to problems are , i do n't want to problems .
this data go on a terrorist war and there sits on the doctor for <unk> , has always the records on , and switched off the decision on this base .
if we now at <unk> came to the sounds like in the may , dance has also had to go down and was , and imagine ourselves , who would eventually a design directives , written , i 'd never been re-inhabited as being , would have that they have the dance in may be going to may , where they go back down is , admittedly , no longer can experience .
and this raises my friend now , one in the netherlands is , too much <unk> , how does manage to .
in the last thing that <unk> today about sixties now by seventy percent of people work at home to die , but in hospitals , institutions , and that these institutions , indeed also , how can this sense , not the ideals of habitat 's an old people , but it 's often a tight , financially in collaboration <unk> of legs there , the <unk> are often <unk> and most remedial at and for yourself this <unk> find there , after my experience , just constrained by instead .
there 's quite homes , the very good address , there 's very <unk> people who were advocating , but if i 'm the <unk> look , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so i was about five , six thousand , who might look <unk> to us admitted to be , i would for me say , it is quite difficult , and dads , and his inner self keep .
it 's obviously <unk> reasons , that 's clearly , this whole quality , that control is why we introduced , because in the past the money for it 's not enough that people , optimal , and across scales that feed into , and that people who are taking care to deliver or the health services , so we 're paid to say , there was -- i worked with a clear , because i can take as caregivers have a family of feed with one or two children .
this has just not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and often enough -- it will also just come .
this introduction of the quality control than a result of time who emerged in the marketplace , the you adjust ever want to work together so we also on the individuals concerned about us .
and now we 'll talk about how to the maybe i ca , so what do we now in the past , because i have the first of questions , and leaves , so we simply is the situation for affected , not .
and where i just that <unk> <unk> and this paper , one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society will always like this structure , as a legal structure , where we do things <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article in one is indeed , the dignity of people 's much untouchable stars .
and the second set up there is , you to protect is supreme commander of the task of all <unk> .
and what i 'll often lacking in which is another third set in there are , because every single also for your brief to have to , he was going to protect and to defend islam .
because it 's a way is to herself to be free from this case , i admit that in other way , and they are supposed to my time somehow we mentor , and feed and then we need that i 'm still would n't worry about doing , like me because even going to die .
because the last time , is yes , but so , though we this subject does n't like to ask , we 're going on the point .
hopefully much later , with hundreds or <unk> .
the equivalent of my career as well , to say , that i hope for each and then i want to be able to worry , but eventually gets you look at the theme have to face , and if it then maybe as far is , or any hope , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it may already late in life to be late in life to say , i want to about this question now start thinking .
so if you think about what do i 'd like , then you 're going on the dots are coming , where in the last to be able to what are really be the five major things in my life has been ?
there 's a book , what 's very , en <unk> is .
it 's the self-esteem of course , there are then the friends who i 've eaten by which i 'm talking and exchange can , who know me and the me through that live along , it 's the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between people by which i may also to do n't have , in <unk> or in a lay down or a pastor or a <unk> or saw in the other people by which i in the relationship to kick .
and there are there 's plenty of those factors of course , the there <unk> , i take the 'm not all around .
but if you think of these three things there ever known to look , then they 've ever was a lot of tasks , how to be in life there might <unk> have to the past its own going to protect .
and there 's got another factor that thinks that we kind of dictatorship in the <unk> experience , and i picked this time , such as a text , or more than a few examples .
other people can use these decisions and this behavior , what 's <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we 'd kind of ourselves come out .
so it 's not the question , what are because others to me to do , who gets me because even today , in activities , or to me use , who goes up to me ?
but it 's in other way , to be asking where i 'm able to people approach , where can i 'm bringing and so my inner would decide that i do with these questions able to interact and i have a good position and technology can .
and if you 'll say , how we 're working , so this is the inside the quality of us from external prosthetic was , it 's a way , to say , i define me about my my inner would , this mechanism to escape .
because no man can see me , it loses , as i do yourself because you see , and position to .
and i got there 's also not fit in general <unk> or conventional wisdom , they said , you have now an advance directives fill and because you know how old they 're going to imagine you know , if you have been re-inhabited as they want to see if you on an icu . will .
these questions that i can in the last only after a long <unk> probably a compelling process .
this would of people 's an interior of posture , the in me is , and the not the outside of which gives you can be that the bureau 's not can protect , also a law , not , and the me that other people <unk> can and i think <unk> be , when i 'm just found themselves before who i asked 've got so you are also know what i was for a person , i am .
and make those conversations to lead , it takes the same spaces , and then i think , and why i put this talk so called , and here in front of pain , are those spaces like this <unk> into food , i did you is both trying to stay on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we over these issues you need to think , where one of exactly the space is , so that there are n't hurt this is that it also may not to our theory is , but that just make a conversation , there is happening .
so we , if we old are , certainly can say , oh , such a dance in the may , despite my angels may very high ages , that would also again , what .
thank you very much for your attention .
and wonderful good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part of making flat , is , really think a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
so , starting with infinite number one thing .
this is really dumb , not , can take you .
what you mean ?
it 's different <unk> ?
there 's infinite enough ?
yes !
this is not good , if this one of it is , the what exactly .
so , in fact , but i long , it down , for those who know it .
that 's what we do n't .
we employ us with just one .
and i crossed the like a little bit down to a finite planet .
<unk> , a finite we know , infinity , make us a to know .
and it 's going to the <unk> take orders of the supply .
if we in a finite out there are , and if you just two <unk> , in an instance , chairs , in the other people .
we know , imagine , already been , we are looking at the box to him , the number is small , it 's three , chairs and it 's three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in lots of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we do it ?
i mean , we would only people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three , chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and beautifully .
that you mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in a finite wonderful , that you can also at large numbers , although it can level-up .
but it matches .
how can see if you count ?
how do n't check that 's how many people like the chairs , there are ?
i realized the chairs and people in them , and not something else .
<unk> let me !
that 's called the couples make .
you very well , that it 's obvious , not , now we 're in the real stuff and even understand that 's also all !
not , that 's very nice .
so , we call this too much advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , putting them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , everything is done , different people get different chairs , not a chair is overhead low and the amount of the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how do we had infinite amount of compare these ?
we would say , the one is that big or more or less than the other .
we could we do it ?
we 'd return to start .
right , it 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite , long mountain range of starting to count , yes , i 'd let 's just say , they are not the time .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so , where it ?
madame ?
way , `` madame !
they had this , but just really started .
they mate .
so , now let me that time .
we estimate , throw it 's an infinite always bad , yeah ?
you see , yes , you see , i did n't end , yeah ?
the point is going to make it very simple .
if i take the <unk> suppose , natural numbers , <unk> , we scientist use the zero in the beginning to zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we should , let 's say , another copy of this <unk> and take from this piece of the end of a lot <unk> pay off .
left would remain the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all this straight line of numbers are <unk> on the end of long line across the natural numbers , but on a band n't have the <unk> , on the others are the line , and the <unk> full circle , okay ?
we call the a lot g , the routes of numbers , we call the other sorts of n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
is , g , more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same size , or smaller ?
the same size ?
but this is very risky , yes , where you do n't know , the <unk> .
who 's another bank estimates that ?
right ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , who has the news is really no plan , yeah ?
that know we can also not be , yeah ?
you can we did n't , where what 's missing , more , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is a popular , what you also suspected of course , is wrong .
and now , and now let me , why the high levels are alike .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the routes of , we take the zero from the natural lot , they mate , out .
another one of zero , for nike plus two of it 's two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the three , the eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that even reverse , it 's has doubled , it 's obvious , <unk> ?
and completely obvious is , through the <unk> we make it that i do it always in the lecture to such a <unk> <unk> .
and here , there are just the line , full circle and the tape is equally long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural diet on the routes , <unk> , the <unk> 're off the tape is still same length .
this is it just in the infinite .
so if you any chance to explain what we have today i learned to have the infinity learned , yes , which is because no end , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of this is a property that is it in a finite right and this trait that says , is absolute <unk> a true , subset of the same size is .
it eventually they in a finite ; it , if you for three three people two people <unk> , then it 's just one there and previously were about three .
yes , so we have an eternity .
is no asleep ?
okay .
then we do n't a second piece of probability .
the professionals , diseases in the odds .
i’m here what brought .
with this experiment , i 'm sure that gets at least one third of know , and <unk> it does anybody with , the thing on it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , b , b , c .
i 've done something hidden , i hope , you have a 's not hear .
and they should go undercover , guess .
so , you mean , i have something hidden , behind the a , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate at a c .
that 's another idea ?
the a ?
that 's another idea ?
virtuous , <unk> , b 's missing , not , usually hear the same -- never on , <unk> ?
so it 's right .
it 's really matter , so they have n't mean , the three of characters are falling and i was looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because , the chance to keep them , jesus being done , which is yes , jesus , just about one-third .
<unk> , there are three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i doing here , i 'm just a way .
well , i know of course , where it 's .
<unk> , this is here somebody , <unk> .
so , so i know , where it is , and the rates and appreciate that , but anyway , you do it 's called , is going into a second round .
so i 'm really the game paint , i 'm basically now only <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , assumed , i <unk> me on the b , <unk> ?
so , now i have a door to show , behind the it 's not only , and the do n't have said .
because , if you will say , and i say , and so i know , it 's probably not of b .
then there would probably not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , bad news : man .
but i have to yes , that 's econ , in the second round off .
so i can just an open , behind the it 's not only is , but what they did n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the diseases in the odds , under the value here was left , under the value that will open is , and it 's not here , they 're going to your last chance , a way to guess .
they must now at the a stick , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm now this up what they want .
or they say , i 'm a c , on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
right now , thank god , that will open , has been , i wanted forever , in the a stick , this is it .
or would you 're saying , in fact <unk> , we have to <unk> , way that , we 've only two doors , now we do n't care , to change , or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's no matter .
<unk> .
why it 's no matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , yes , it 's wrong .
this seems right now , as if we actually yesterday that greeted would , <unk> ?
but how they are , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , apparently , the thing is very <unk> , yes .
this sense of all between , i do n't , six and , yes , i ca n't sixties years , otherwise would have no longer be part , <unk> ?
so , it to understand what everybody .
after this door , because it to a third .
and it 's been only to a third of a door .
they 're able to guess what you want , they do with two thirds of them in the dirt .
i mean , they would be able to two doors to guess , not , that can you know what happens when <unk> do , you can say on two dozen that 's seat , then it is yes , <unk> , if you are zero time <unk> , this is it mean everything in life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , here is the way , two thirds of it 's no , what you guess .
so this is two thirds of here , but it could n't just behind a door to lie !
behind the is n't get it !
so , which is then more likely ?
way , i really have it 's hidden .
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , clearly !
so , that 's not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got unlucky . man .
why ?
so simple , including two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for anybody what the end .
thank you .
mr. <unk> to me like jamie oliver <unk> , the here in terms of bad food and bad food and overweight people 's news has , this depressed as a very well , completely .
but i whistle , '' my best thing that later everything again , is , these experiences .
i come . '' this is from the <unk> farm and i knew then i 12 signature was no , mcdonald 's .
that ever known for business , right .
, yes .
thank you for the references you today .
i 'm here around that i grew up .
and i do n't know whether you sir <unk> also run on it came to me to be asking whether i at ted , at sea and others will , and over a particular topic want to share .
i 'm <unk> <unk> : this theme of trust .
now , motivation is not too bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> on , who said , he said , maybe it makes the or another and after all sports .
only i also full of this to have .
so tonight about the rain more and run off to be now <unk> much longer required athletes , but i have this morning in fact that train , because i in three weeks on <unk> june , at <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to want to <unk> bicycle company -- that are <unk> miles .
what gives me that morning when rains this training do n't get freed up .
so who have a ride want to <unk> to go tomorrow morning , starting in <unk> , i post '' they all welcome .
i have made of separation has already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i '' started out extra , with the theme <unk> .
do n't worry , the beauty , if you refuse to the blind faith , come up afterwards <unk> .
i '' before me a second thoughts about it made , when i <unk> 'm going to describe my best , where i <unk> ?
so , i come from <unk> village with six ] houses , many <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents coming on farm there 's apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what do you out <unk> `` beer .
trust , in sports , obviously not in <unk> but with me , <unk> and beer .
why the bat '' i the story , where i come ?
for me is one of the very big stories that i really that actually gone from the land , the village , eh . ' and there was raised me with two big brothers , with the oldest one brother , the <unk> is .
and with the other brother , the same way we 're blind , like me .
they say , the see light and dark , the can see how i thought life also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it on lights , or out .
what today , very convenient is for the police knocked another .
the , or we 're both can just see , when looking at something is .
'n pole , but i say , ' time i ca n't distinguish , is <unk> man <unk> pole .
of on the old men , <unk> .
i used to go and pick .
and what to me , but always there was critical , is obviously come on the fact , how it written you trust and we’ve certainly saw this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , 'that 's my time .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , outside my brother and i still not even blind people knew .
we were so the first , the next was quite a sudden in their lives <unk> are .
and then you from the situation seems to what do .
and , now i love me , it 's a huge fortunate that my parents were farmers are not the day long time had to us to stand and look at the hand , to bring up to say there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you know , along and can then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning of us that encouraged , always going to go , kind of my unsighted brother is .
so , at home alone <unk> , the stairs , <unk> and <unk> , it also look at risk .
there 's the blind brother 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> courtyard , subsequently <unk> believer in .
the complex the complex , i have this day before .
so is that to the big brothers -- who are not only good for your elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i do so ham in <unk> courtyard is used to be true all out there 's done , what ma , ' room could do , in particular instance , bike ride .
and that 's the <unk> brother , with delight in three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and i 've got started out with <unk> to drive , as before , many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that even starting with <unk> , eventually leaving .

and how to get you that trust , one that trust the parents , that are also come back from a bicycle <unk> and <unk> and other thing that trust of us that we 're not permanently , where it down .
and our solution was that we obviously a , from our parents tell us have now , where are the <unk> , so where is a car , where <unk> followers , where are you might look at any unfamiliar in the left , sure enough homes -- the brain makes you 're not the way -- there , we knew that they are .
and we had to us in between orient to us that one of sense , but the other i also hear .
and that you can now , in here who does n't all the test , because otherwise become it 's so loud , that it 's nothing more of them have .
but <unk> . '' this evening , if you get away from light of pick up and in their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom , whatever , then they orient to .
you can you 'll try to just <unk> associate with the tongue , so , up to orient and you 'll notice that 's around us humans as in the bats as well -- they become a resistance to hear .
so how the bats are so with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound is used differently <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , even on the movement , always very important to have worked .
but <unk> super high <unk> to have and the security , i ' <unk> chance to me because <unk> piece to help .
and i used to orient to no big trouble and i knew even without many accidents , the one or else we did course , already .
what i 'm sorry , today , no pictures over a piece of that i 'm very <unk> which is , by one of <unk> as children .
because the mountain climbing onto our higher building on <unk> farm .
i '' here 's a quote : the confidence , also emerging from a <unk> diversity .
and that my ' i already quite literally , because i was a person who are much too late in <unk> and in the <unk> to rely on the scientific side of busy doing . ' , i 'm about one thing was never know , or i 'm not so i tripped on how i do it , which i 've experienced .
it made of the never been used , but substantially read .
but it 's probably also to do with that it certainly not everybody 's exactly , experimentally to see that we can .
and diversity is the creation of our strengths with this <unk> to come to know , where i 'm pretty well , what i 've got talent and where can i saw my strengths in fact , too full <unk> ?
and our brother , indeed , again , who did michael and i 've always took on top of the house .
so he then he said : okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
because you can probably somewhere out <unk> window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the morton was then started , michael afterwards , and i ' there probably still <unk> bit like this girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but after that , who stays with the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i believe that one of the goods , we 're probably the next generation of young women , here , not .
and of why am i know , then i still with .
and then i was taken the consequence that we eventually , every three <unk> <unk> up sitting , and the dad with <unk> followers , with <unk> <unk> walked up and even more know , what he 's actually tell you want .
because they trust is naturally go away , if any doubt .
if the father so i said to my god , help to help to help , then only one of the danger , relative size it was that one of us too afraid of the tip would and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't -- somehow <unk> would be .
alrighty , '' but never happens .
he had to go up and so <unk> that it 's just imagine again , gradually <unk> has or by johannes <unk> has , of us , then returned .
and that was ' i 'm concerned with quite amazing , that we opportunities that had .
but now , you do n't worry , it’s not a principal , not necessary to later <unk> to do .
for me were different striking , the in my life always important were , all , yes , interesting .
and in particular , they were all this <unk> , because i thought life also see things : where did ' i so i have limits what are perhaps like my endowments .
so to <unk> good <unk> i would never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , ' day i do n't like in <unk> .
i go , ' day i 'm out in the rain .
now also not to five degrees , as in the moment .
and at <unk> rainfall -- but rather than outdoor models .
but i ' time for me like this faith in my strengths with found that i different striking to try on 'em .
as the first instance <unk> .
and it was for me very good , because there 's also the instructor , of us in <unk> had , has said , ok , we have it 's louder <unk> children , but they send it ' us <unk> couple of the blind children .
really about it sounds good , because there , puts you may belong to each other end to poke them .
and then makes you know , what the other .
and there was always like my big trust , of course , when i the competition for a place , let 's a 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps , but what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so it 's just a way , and this is confidence in my fast .

i push it 's not try it .
i 'd like me thinking , but <unk> .
i believe that ' , this is now <unk> bit risky stuff .
and that i would be here 's not voluntary , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' time .
okay .
the next to me point was a sports , in school ago , and then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or is this day <unk> and that they 're also are trained as children .
but for me was always in school stopped very important : how can i 'm still a lot also looking at school , they 're going to my excess energy in her life ?
and then i had then as a way in school <unk> to do .
and while i actually always thought , that 's all kind of <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> likely to love ' i .
i found ' i once -- love ' i 'm not anymore .
i then eventually said : well , i do with the <unk> .
and said , '' then saw in the first realized that person , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because you condition , needs , you need power , ai n't good coordination , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you might have a lot also of their work in the society ?
this is what it also in <unk> .
you 'll only then quickly , if you saw the full of trust in your technology has .
if you this faith in your performance has -- so the force that you the same as well then at any circumstances , as bad weather , at yield to snow , when <unk> snow has to skiing can be .
and if you in my case just saw their faith in the team has .
because when <unk> , who are n't see , so i 'm depend <unk> <unk> .
and it 's never make a hellish freeway on like today -- i have the word used -- my <unk> -- because we did the only one -- has now there before my practice .
power , but nothing , we do n't yet again .
specifically , i <unk> get them now maybe just .
do with one , one , one after another practice .
what i actually used to do with the subject of the blind faith , this is the practice that i did the listener is just imagine going to let 's like this is , if you do n't see just <unk> to make up with their 40s <unk> <unk> .
when <unk> <unk> yes , so , you have two sticks in my hand .
of why : yeah , have a ' i 'm not one hand anymore , face , otherwise would i mean , my ' <unk> take and after the <unk> below .
does n't .
so i must be different helping .
i 've got my <unk> that the years ago , i 'm running .
and the told me with the voice , the route .
so the needs to just always wanting precise <unk> do .
and again , it 's important to trust .
the precision on the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> going to tell me <unk> and <unk> about who says , then , the left at 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of the old-fashioned o'clock at the pointer .
if he says , the left over 10 little sharper to left , and if he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to go ask folks , or they want to me again , i think again , then i learned in any case , now is what do n't .
and to me is yes , this very large , critical , if the <unk> ago i 'm running , then i have the really completely <unk> about it 's negative to say .
it 's positive way to say it 's for me that tool , that it enables me , just really go quickly to be and in <unk> even faster than others , the in the competition to start .
and that i can only when i 'm a 's just manage , with both arms me <unk> to me <unk> , on a leg anchored to stand and i have now actually the eyes to do -- ha ha -- or she can also open , me , which brings you know anything .
and must then just like <unk> and have to go on the other one leg and the same way back to stand and down here <unk> bit of balance , but has actually more silent hand .
well with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me that very important point , when i 'm with <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i say a guy , because i actually just for guys <unk> had , as i create a 's the room to say `` hey , you got me with the <unk> do , because of course , the it : yeah , ourselves .
the white is not so , what he told me tell you have .
so i 've [ to him the way to communicate , just open it needs .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
so if my needs n't know , he can tell me naturally do n't help , but i got to just wondered , and must say , well , i need bees ' of you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used <unk> .
or i need bees ' of you like now riding that you i saw in the same time she says , how long period of the mountain go with this is , because if we the <unk> <unk> , because i think you know , ever : now , it must be over .
and as well , again , basically like nuts and the thing you hear , not on .
and then i need bees ' point , i 've also look at the pilot , how it as i 'm cycling , i mean , on <unk> <unk> forward , the me and says we 've come back after 20 minutes of us , because we may -- so we ham the recent times <unk> minutes used -- then is it means , but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me really important , there 's also the exact name , powerful diagnostic <unk> to have .
i listen , ' <unk> -- there is it goes the other , the same <unk> <unk> down ?
who provides more ?
so my best was time ever faster , but this was in september , and now so in april , may , i know , frankly , i 've ever been much more quickly made it , and thirty-six years ago .
and in your forecast on right across <unk> .
and for me , as i said , these exact <unk> only then as possible , when i saw my ears , open 'em .
the other i saw was also explained , what he around you see , and i 'm so the possibility is , talking about issues related to estimate .
and this is for me the very important things , why i 'm saying , trust is more training and not that <unk> <unk> .
so , jesus ' away as a blind now is not much , frankly -- from <unk> .
because i 've been doing this experience we had to me a <unk> right , and left is wrong <unk> had .
and then i was in the competition used to be bad , because it 's side of the route to three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- as i said , this was -- of course <unk> accident .
that i also because the <unk> must be yes , spin , have so <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm going on it is still is continuously , that i got people saying goes left and say , then , <unk> , the other side .
so i was then you still right , unfortunately .
power in the real thing is not much .
but of course , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you might be all of the work or the university , but anyway , if it 's rapidly go to .
then is obviously , precision , usually , yes <unk> <unk> tough challenges .
but for me , as i said , '' is the blind faith is happening all about that i the risks that you know what needs .
and then i must be honest , say , i 'm being someone who does n't see , relative size in favor , because i <unk> ' i took risks in ways .
so when <unk> <unk> ' i 'm sort of all .
the driving <unk> tree , by pop into the slope , down <unk> , who know , and i and i <unk> of course there -- and well that 's important thing -- i <unk> ' either the good news sites .
the fact , then also be done can , if that trust is happening is there .
and if you know somebody has found , the same thing to be a hundred percent of so <unk> , as i 's just need .
and when i all about also have the goals did .
because this is for me in the subject of trust you saw the next , very important point .
you need the same spot , and i have just really also clear to which means it 's really , like trusting too long ?
because of is often <unk> on the term , the you would be used .
i trust at the or the right myself .
but this very key is yes , that this too much connected .
that you for that you to trust a lot <unk> .
and that you know , and also -- because we do anything with <unk> <unk> <unk> that somehow -- we want <unk> sense that really see .
and the sense , the is quite often that indeed we also create , 'n bring together to achieve .
that we manage -- in my case for example -- of them , yes , weeks , got ' i 'm going on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just like , i have to me now somebody to look for the or the i in the case , how do n't trust that i saw this mountain also the top to reach .
and how do you of course , that you go on the mountain , but eventually got up there ?
well , yeah , i 'd like , the huge advantage , i have made of some 'm not to figure out , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively <unk> .
ca <unk> advantage to be great heights that is no problem .
and i ' either , and out of heights that worked , now , regardless of the <unk> i 'm going down and to look at the job . ' i 'll give you 've done <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew too , because you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
it is quite <unk> bit <unk> , if you 'll be standing up underneath the car stop , then you have n't even more see , to go to know , now , do it hurts when i 'm <unk> .
and things like this is for me more interesting was .

and this is exactly <unk> <unk> bit as <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you 're born every 10 hours before away and it 's going to just not boring
you go and go and they were stone around them yourselves , more plants .
you put on <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun goes out front <unk> first world war , when they 've got .
so if you <unk> wholesale , you see , then is the <unk> about the last , the <unk> .
of the only then so this branch , exciting .
we have the wholesale killing all of the distance ever seen or the other room .
of so <unk> ' i mean <unk> great confidence in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> that he 's only had .
because i thought was ' `` well , so , as i said , because <unk> ' i might actually speeding away , how to the thing which literally has .
but as i said , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you know about <unk> actually i 'm not so very much change .
and really exciting is that 's and then , if you know anything to be hard .
so if you go into the height of the air , and the air to be thinner is .
or if it , the next one off , if you 'll <unk> little <unk> 's where it 's left and right off .
it 's particularly beautiful and if it will also last night is , and all with a headlight <unk> , then they start with us in the <unk> before i said : now , he would i prefer to the rope off , so he then i 'm also really out for and in having .
because i was only without a headlight , because <unk> and this was him , then , but sometimes to be risky stuff .
trust , we 've also created that i just said audio : well , i can course of my <unk> , my friend , the process was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> of them and we 've done before good <unk> .
but i need bees ' either <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus has , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain under constant , says <unk> stone , right , right on one , the left at 11 .
there will eventually you <unk> , which is all .
so for us is confidence in the case was , which we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a wire to your backpack of grass , that i had in my hand , and i 've got behind her in which loosely <unk> tightrope walk .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> bit of the height of stairs i realized inside .

and what i do things happening really been , how beautiful it 's actually , you kind of course , i realized then some point out there the top of approaching because you know that goal really so again in the corner , proximity is -- just kind of the same as <unk> , in weightlifting .
other thing is it , but one thing , i realized inside of that trust me to come in my job of that is one of 10 , only there , when i 'm really <unk> goal became one of how you saw the top .
but that trust is in other there , the <unk> , like trust and just work .
when we then makes towns and the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group is often very ahead and behind us are the other seven people walked and they were increasingly less dense behind us and it has to every moment was someone else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why would remain the because why are moving because wherever anybody that he got behind us can run ?
at night , you can also the girls not from behind back home .
this is somehow not the reason it looks .
and then audio . ' i eventually they noted , ah , ok , suffice to their faith in their skills that 's degree , also some pretty <unk> .
you go down at night by the darkness , you about 12 p.m. , at it 's got ta go undercover , no light .
this is really tiring , if you <unk> is , the air will be thin , so it 's tiring and now , no longer <unk> yeah .
and then come , but eventually , so the moment , where the happen to have said : yeah , man , that was actually really practical , behind you to go , because the friend of mine got me just all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women , you know how do .
have all night let 's anything about and the other in the group had the right there is used to be the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's just <unk> hour , that 's got me then told .
or i would tell you know what 's a different now not from the mountain , telling .
and the thing to know , it 's anybody else there , where it might just lousy about <unk> about perhaps we had ever talked about -- it 's just <unk> hour , the sun comes up on .
these same things that even mirrors from outside can trust , again , significantly increase and can just to contribute that you look like the personal medal but just done .
and to me is confidence in particular , then given , and it 's all about the perfect , if you just like the personal medal and that which is happening really want , then eventually , even on the idea of the right there is .

so i believe that ' at some medals that it 's so , in vancouver , who were six hundred grams a hard .
if it had gold would , then <unk> i 'm not here , then i would have on the bahamas , believe me .
now , or in , lichtenstein , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i believe that one of the real , why you do that , is more , that you can imagine : what did ' i actually types of water and as i have my skills and forces are focused on a point .
how did ' i in me in my skills , but obviously in the team that we all need , no matter whether in school , in the job in which one thing , whatever .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need to just people , even on the we ca n't trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear before you have eyes and that 's also have reached out , this is that the best of evidence that we at least in a project in our lives of things .
and if you 're serving time , it 's also would certainly in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , this is the title of my talk , the happened is to <unk> its beautiful maps .
what i tick , is the whole <unk> juice , the sciences , again as something <unk> in general population to attach .
basically what i could be satisfied .
if i get into barnes <unk> , it 's all <unk> only with the literature to science data subjects , the <unk> <unk> is .
even more than any <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the scientific stories , new breed of topics , sort of meaning out be represented .
every station has at least a <unk> , where some scientific data subjects in processing .
even , this is totally <unk> , if you watch , what it in magazines and <unk> for children who are the science stuff .
every program has sort of on a kind of a plume off in <unk> , but nevertheless , is that a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing , the ones can i want to see that can i love to read , but that this affected me it’s not themselves .
cool , is cool science just a way around on csi , in breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
on csi to such a <unk> five minutes , has nothing with the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , because i can find myself identifying .
big bang theory , because i can get into laughter , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is particularly bad .
because , that 's kind of a little bit counterintuitive , the future we 'll just manage to deal with these technological issues and stuff .
but at bay area that 's not going on themselves off .
i have a few little examples here has native americans , like science , or science starting with us in such a special significance of .
a very <unk> example : in london , you have a nice little tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build this time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now that the sunlight from above in the facade , falls , and i picked this time <unk> suggesting , which is focused , and then , somewhere in other section of at the stage centre .
this was the size by the press , there was actually is a particularly the jaguar .
shame , the heat up , so <unk> that this poor <unk> , the really long , long life saved up , there are the <unk> ' time .
so to get asked yourself , such an architect , has n't actually sort of times as a bit of what in physics learned , because i mean , is yes , totally fresh , that such a mirror in the left is focused .
so , what i found , which is really new , is <unk> , some centuries before christ , where he said that with radiation , a fleet sank carrying .
this question i 'm really , which was the more design or an architect , or where he studies math ?
now this is a very <unk> example .
a classic , which one special significance of such as we see things have , is also the genetic engineering .
genetic engineering , that has already been a few years ago , as it 's just in the media design moment .
there was the train has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at once a danger .
genes that was a sense of green , and engineering .
genes been somehow what the outcome .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there have situations where in the market , farmers who have gotten to have `` hey , i 've <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yes .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get into discussing .
but the time i was at the lab and they 're actively ] and was going to know , frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my day my neighbor , <unk> , you see , but not happy with in which is because this ?
i like this : yeah , i 'm trying been there are three days , so little gene in my bacterial cells to transform and it all .
this was , what i 've tried to try to explain so somehow a first decoded , genetics , i thought , yes , it goes down the good , madam , when i of genes do n't speak to know you already , what she says .
this was , what i actually said , so one particular sequence that i think there in this <unk> <unk> i wanted .
but this was , what the woman in another .
this woman has i never forget the hand , i shook up .
who knows that i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's the outcome .
this is already been a bit about 10 years ago , and yet that has sort of consciousness is grounded .
genes , this is conveying is what the outcome .
<unk> i have very long could n't read .
there will always the gene 's free and it does n't really in our language , describes what happened .
<unk> indulge into europe , was a headline .


yeah , it was also a beautiful headline .


fortunately , it 's not yet <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , that takes too , no longer length .
but that’s simply shows , which of insecurity in the population is now , because they just does n't with the stuff on afterwards .
nevertheless , we have in our future us with these technologies to engage them .
now i was just <unk> , nobody had this big on the topic , but it 'll talk about the item and touch of which most really no idea has .
and that 's pretty sad .
why is actually all this information from the lab in the population ?
if we to suggest that little boy , to comment , where are sitting in his lab , has an experiment , <unk> anything , beautiful and well , and he drops is , damn it 's what that interested , but the public .
then you have the first of the professor go .
the leader who decides he then , okay , very cool topic , puts his name on it as <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i 'm not now in public , it goes on a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh great idea , class , because we make a press hooked .
<unk> , here is a press left with a project , a nice idea , and this is coming then sort out of ivory tower .
this is then <unk> , yes , but at who really ?
now are like cancer is rarely go alone , usually a couple of <unk> such a shared the porters , a common <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> , the really cool projects , then , are over the <unk> at the magazine , given , at the editors , whether it took leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
from the base , there will keep filtered out in ivory tower , up until the fact , really cool kind of trial then , that actually speak of projects , there in that 's <unk> come up .
that are quality magazine , who are actually done well , it 's of all there 's free , yes , but who reach i mean ?
basically just the who became interested in it .
in the <unk> we call it always the <unk> is almost maniacally .
so who may belong to have been interested in it , who feeds and she got the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
beautiful design magazines , reached the audience , the who became interested in it , and the maybe about an idea of , where <unk> going to it even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i mean , but really ?
the maniacally , who do it anyway , what interests .
the way , this is now , yes , the otto , ordinary citizen , i call it 's lord <unk> <unk> , the in certain circumstances of the publications i read , i 've tried , it was neutral be trying to reach i do n't really .
anyway , again , our future we 'll just sort of mastery you can , if we wanted to those <unk> engage them .
fracking , engineering , renewables , <unk> , are all together , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the it seems to vote is .
my project , my idea is so , different to scale-up , this little , young , engaged , where are out of ivory tower , to take , really fully by its normal <unk> to separate , and he was there 's a course , to be , a seminar that looks like science is intelligible to communicate .
because what usually happens that a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know where we 've been a bit about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at a unwritten rule , it 's not for his job to ask .
once it the mouth <unk> and over his career telling it , he 's fully into .
<unk> , that are scientists who tell you do is a kind of <unk> .
jintao , listen to chemically on , <unk> , chemically 's already nearly as the same level of genes .
chemically treated , this is somehow , oh , you do n't know what is .
the really teach , hey , to give up , that 's beautiful and well , if you on a conference , and having your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want , then you can be like of <unk> tell , but you blinding again , let’s just add some water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , so , this is my idea , these young scientist , the right now , so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , who still a little more malleable , are , the school i , how to bury our argument .
this has to use them to use , <unk> , but anyway , and investors who want to be able to know what 's in the <unk> happens .
eventually they did it as well , tax , the there are used , so the need to actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , this is just a story .

there 's a quote , i do n't know , if this is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , you 've got it 's not really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how can i do this natural as expected to communicate ?
so storytelling is it already several .
<unk> are totally modern , which is everywhere , in on every college , really typical energy , but they reach i basically just the key is maniacally .

this is the ones that it anyway , what interests .
i 've got back to my <unk> .
so , are the people who became `` excuse for interest to go ride motorbikes and playing out of those talks back .
that 's beautiful , there are working with <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all you 're happy , driving home and this is it .
so they sit , i still on a second thing , to say , it does n't say that <unk> the project .
these scientists are also been trained as all wired , actually children ?
because many really <unk> have to look at the key to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children in their world , exploring , is the same .
children are working very extreme to scientifically .
they do something like to learn the walk .
they try something , this work ?
<unk> , falling down , way to do n't work , next to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , i do it 'll make new .
children learn to be very scientific definition .
so there 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which of factors i do something needs , that it did n't it .
this is normal .
but that we have a <unk> .
and of why i think , really can work that , but i know that the <unk> create , and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the primary school , there other experiments to make the children , across their <unk> , and there really do it with , because i 'm convinced me that the children and the scientists are actually basically the same language .
and then you can maybe , eventually , this is so my hope to tell the kids that will be looking at home , and then you reach me as mr. <unk> , the go up again into action to breakthroughs with very interested , because the children beside him that tell .
so this is not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , when galileo , but his children to tell him a thing that it <unk> spiegel at <unk> was working to think it 's a bread <unk> has to think it 's where the paper that lit up , and understand then also , and shake and then maybe even the head , as an architect , such a house can build .
and not simply reach me off course , mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it just remember that the first <unk> that i call you have to have said , yes , way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that this is just not subject , who just had other priorities .
a scientist has did n't can communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , then i call and i the next thing .
but who somehow , in an institution to work , <unk> is in a company , but anyway , there 's going on the next moment .
thank you .
i 've gone mad , which is the question .
take it can not every day .
the past weeks were terrible .
the weather comes to us a big group by the calculation .
in front of seven , after eight years , i 've ever been , if i 'm going to take you want .
i was first ceo , almost 10 years , at the <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there 's fairly close up here .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me it was really what i mean , it 's <unk> .
what is this really ?
<unk> , that 's pretty ridiculous .
i then , but i 've learned about who really stuck and so i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a bit , but it 's in any case , too much -- emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'll just give in the next to join , eighteen minutes a little bit of this life of a <unk> tell .
i 'm the ceo in <unk> .
the company , there was a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company has been 20 years .
and managing the <unk> .
the company has been sort of nineteen or hit eighteen years .
the managing the zeppelin here at the <unk> .
zeppelin .

there is the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and these are actually just along the last 10 to action .
this is already what .
there 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so this is actually not a market .
this is also less than an up-close picture .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why we doing this will be here ?
how does it possible ?
<unk> in the solution , and only 10 to action , because we up afterwards , again to talk about why that 's .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> has one of a lot of crazy <unk> <unk> the airline travel here 's started .
very quick quick .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war or so eighteen <unk> , where we launched .
and then they were in the first world war , <unk> zeppelin was dying of the way <unk> and join , were about <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have to go in london , it bombed , and so forth and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london was here are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , were the english newspapers <unk> full of the title : this time they come up , but not to bombs , but in new peaceful intent .
so that 's the story because he put <unk> .
and we had a deliberate misdirection campaign .
but <unk> , the client who was n't quite pleased to because he suddenly there 's become , which there behind what apparently , the old memory in there 'd put it .
and you know that was taken for the marketing -- a critical .
but nevertheless , it was in london a good dress campaign for the weather in north end up there was many years ago pretty bad and very windy .
and we 're not very much went .
you 've got <unk> decades , <unk> 21 , hugo <unk> have adopted that .
and has a <unk> accomplished that go to america and shipped down .
this has a myth that their reasons , that all the german nation and actually put up again something felt was , when you know <unk> and <unk> that airship that takes down .
there was the then in new york , was welcomed with a ticker tape .
and all the german nation has stood up <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in my whole lives , so stuck inside and this is something that tells a bit of this country of this device .
but they 're trying to go to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven zeppelins even more being built and actually just two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg , the passengers conveyed them .
passengers , a hundred , where about <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> and then it was the first stage filmed crash with this as well unfortunately , yes <unk> .
but beyond the titanic that event that time , where a one icon , a a product , drowned , and then also never more and then in midair .
well , the other boxes being biased .
and <unk> , <unk> the last still exists for zeppelins destroyed .
the most of materials that uses for <unk> , <unk> , the halls , mined land .
and then i was a long , nothing about sixties years .
and then they had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin , who had the idea , maybe you know that back to start .
and i was discontinued <unk> , because it 's technically a brilliant product has evolved to come we 'll talk , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
so what actually matter ?
so .
and talk , we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that may still going to explain , we ham the time doing yet , <unk> , people have a lot of occasions .
there are many companies , the one of corporation , have been born .
there are today <unk> staff , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a real <unk> , high as profitable .
there is a lot behind .
they get me then also believe , here to come .

is like a whale , the in the water and go down below it shows , and since the <unk> do n't help .
the time is not there yet , that in the details to explain .
inside that 's a zeppelin like , with a structure .
there are two types of <unk> .
there are stuck , <unk> , that 's us , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
they get inside , no structure and they are basically like a balloon , in <unk> .
that are most <unk> , in the world 's never designed are , or so , four- , five hundred piece .
and that there are today , as i said earlier , just <unk> in that or minus to our own population , so it’s round , only two decades .
so what happens then the production of , if an envelope of grew up .
the left the structure , again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
comes from <unk> .
it happened : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the roots .
10th one point two million dollars , such a shell .
and it 's got <unk> be , has <unk> be and also has <unk> be , because every once you have yes , looking , that if i just a crack in it would be a hole that 's nothing to tear it can .
there are the <unk> again <unk> do and see exactly , if i 'm going on the holes in control .
and the end looks a controlled airship on without the bronx that out how it 's there .
the zeppelin -- is so technically a <unk> product .
and that you look down here at the numbers , very short time .
one point , nine percent , one point , nine percent , one point , six times four percent <unk> which means of thousands of thousands flights in the year or fall , maybe <unk> out .
this is very low and very good .
this is a <unk> .
the can see .
but there 's another trend , of us right now look less power and the 've got up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started in front <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were in their sixties percent .
if you are eight years , talking about eight years , in the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> this might expect to , then you can say at least in these eight years , of course of the blink of <unk> , also clear , in these eight years that has weather , clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can be the passengers were also not a mist would fly .
the want to say something you see .
and the <unk> or <unk> increase in every year go slowly explore .
so a little picture of the fact that our weather is not just feel safer , well statistically , because we do shine , every day , changes .
but because that 's so , so this is that well , has the e.u. , a program being remade <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come this morning , just went from finland .
this airship that 's here is equipped in which is a flying lab today .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the surface and <unk> feet .
the name of planetary <unk> .
and the zeppelin t 's going to italy by up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
by many many hundreds <unk> measuring the and analyzed the air in the way to chemically , as you 're reacting to our things are the bottom , do .
there , how i just declared , up there are we with the other airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and it 's when you will , what actually extracted from the subject of weather .
that 's so very good .

this is controlled airship on in sweden , last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way , the weather and super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the finns may say something that they had never .
i am i 'd go up just wonderful , you find the warm , a firsthand .
the mosquito and then also not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to aubrey de <unk> as <unk> diamond , looking for the , should say , volcanoes go searching , the underground of those who wear away is through the erosion of a million years .
but you can also be asking , is , that 's all over africa , is that then one seemed like if you to bring some questions , after an idea of questions , after some questions is it makes sense when the same time in cinema all at the film <unk> or the blood diamond 's has gone .
i 've got me once asked , so what do we could n't really ?
and what do we could n't really ?
the end , we were two years , then also done .
the ode was then also not on .
the entire <unk> came back <unk> and this project was then they killed .
and a tornado that 's the zeppelin was in the mast , and then , so broken , that he also going down to stay in anything .
i was , but not so bad .
we 've got very good insurance , and they were actually quite happy .
this thing about the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do with a moment .
yes , what we 're doing today , a very brief <unk> from the <unk> .
what we 're doing today , it comes along the same order , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or lifestyle .
what do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do from engineering of course .
we need to the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> -- aging .
there are the news is always been put inside , after 10 , or 15 yet again , which will be replaced .
we replace it just the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk more we .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're an airline <unk> company , the of the germans <unk> and of the european governance is controlled , always try and the time , with ethical reviews , how <unk> well , or so but airbus .
this is also <unk> and costs money and have to keep it also keep going .
the question is : do you actually on ?
you want to move forward ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you could n't really ?
you go further into the market ?
you go further into practice ?
and the course we have in my time ever attempted .
and here is also some <unk> suffered .
how the way too , the <unk> zeppelin was a couple <unk> was suffering and overhead , broke out .
in the beginning to the billboard that said , even the donation of <unk> .
the population of german age population has it 's then rescued by six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes and because he basically a bust , which has the population with him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies built , otherwise we <unk> or <unk> i today anyway , not here and other companies would be seen .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco , with a client .
basically put an extremely potent investor .
two projects are actually failed .
so well <unk> .
meanwhile , we have <unk> won .
and i 'm not a picture that , because we do this <unk> emblem n't show you can .
but in america 's going <unk> of the first <unk> in the get done .
we have three of cds .
with <unk> we build such a , with a partner while the technique again .
and this is a great success , but also the defeat the same .
two customers are basically to liquidate been , because it 's not walking .
why did n't it ?
we know it already be .
either it was the site is not the right or the passengers if we needed to go far <unk> or in america does n't know what you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham , people <unk> , have this is controlled airship that , have said <unk> , which is another , which is another <unk> , the power plug .
there is the did n't that you there <unk> can .
and it was actually doubling pair of difficult in marketing is over to bring , `` hey , people call at odds .
<unk> going very good .
the pilots to hold in the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we 've just <unk> made it , because of weather .
there are then the same time a half million .
so this is bad .
the zeppelin flies <unk> routes , here .
it 's the point , the course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we basically did n't do advertising , because it 's mouth to shut down and again and we about <unk> sold their voucher could have and people say , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it with friends , we know , who also keep , in the family .
and we are great hired .
what i kept going to clean have to the mistake that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still more of flying through .
we have such a <unk> at <unk> and we were <unk> .
it is actually also not quite .
we do too frightening .
this is just an art project has been doing an audi sponsored by .
and an audi has done this here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and we have to even sometimes the <unk> ask : power plug it 's always adds up ?
and we , yes , to be enough ads , but the internet has a lot of changes , the <unk> about the beginning to go , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there today , just 10 , active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two , active , one , packed up , that <unk> , three has <unk> bought , 10 percent are active .
so are then six of 10 .
this means we 're then the market in fact , if it even one is , 24/7 .
and hope , it again a future we expect to be .
and what the end of david , scott , commander of the apollo 15 , after he <unk> paris <unk> and five , he said : dad to the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's nice .
do advertising , we also you .
but we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological .
here is this client .
this is not permanently eroding earth .
it 's <unk> to go and down .
so one such a bid for it takes years until you to get .
and then there then she was no .
there 's too funny effect , the easy for and hard to control are .
in any case is that the situation , <unk> , a point in a globalizing world , so actually not a market .
yet we 'll move .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
so what they were just the question : in what shape we make it on ?
how much money give us in the globalizing world ?
what do what do for here ?
in what shape is it 's powered by side ?
and i personally , they did also asked , some personal to say , i 'm obviously , alongside my background <unk> , where i go <unk> <unk> wanted to go back against the big , drag , also <unk> is a little <unk> dead so you want , it goes again , to rescue .
i was also think about greenpeace , three years <unk> , i went through the vancouver island of risks -- and this entire <unk> jungle , i 've seen , i was this kind of academia , that i 'm there 's doing what’s possible .
and there was a <unk> about greenpeace , the money and suffocated that are , and did n't know what they do with them and almost like to effectively gone bust .
and then they got hired to the way to retool prisons .
and i have three years for greenpeace to run than <unk> and now i do this in the hope , a future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , that right ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thanks .
this is my three things that i do in the eighteen minutes talking to .
why we are today in excess , or have plenty of ?
how we come to the livelihood , ?
and in particular , what do ?
what 's what about it 's really ?
we start with our initial point .
the first part there may be depressing .
but it 's also its bells , the challenges to show .
on a few years only one of the more difficult to have to speak to explain .
that we a problem now have to know every child .
that we environmental problems have .
but it 's worth it ever again , and might suggest that are the challenges that growth for example .
all kinds <unk> 're integrating exponential increase .
if you see it 's in a historical , long term , you see , the oil hits for example , then it 's a very short , episode in the story that i could be .
now , we can not imagine that this kind of different walks , when that hits , keep moving up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , the past , there 's the columbian , we look at the last <unk> years on .
that you can also <unk> look , love ' i also true .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes then , yes , get a bit closer , so busy to speak about the real challenge to the things that it really to avoid any clinical trial , otherwise we 've just difficulties in the <unk> , at the health .
<unk> means there 's about 30 degrees .
and there 's hear it degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> kind of becoming increasingly more as bad .
it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas , where the big jets might not known , and the <unk> some extent that there is continuously at the water from the himalayas is coming .
it 's the end , not really about the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , there was pretty much larger environmental crisis .
and churning out , but it 's about us to the people to speak up in a huge ecological systems very awkward will live .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts , we spread out .
the water is becoming increasingly less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , comes from .
and this all , where that come from ?
all these terrible things , 'that ' i 'll get stuck in the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
with , what we all of the earth , get , what we harvest .
not only ones that the oil and these metals together and the minerals , but those renewables commodities are out these renewable , but after about altogether .
and we should simply watch that we as few of them to use to even after much waste and cut emissions to produce .
so it gets about this is in the introduction was already have been the entire <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , o 's two , <unk> by a car on another , but really different to live .
the way that economies .
our technology essentially completely to change .
if we 'll just look back the hunters and as collectors , and there are still on earth societies who basically like life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time of human history , three or five million tons .
now , it 's 15 or <unk> .
so <unk> has this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed around .
it 's in north more than with us with us more than for the earth 's portable , is .
and in part of the world , look for africa , very , much less .
and comes up , we 're pushing the implications for us , the rivers , the air is much better have grown in the last decades , but it 's basically , strongly that we 've done in other parts of the world 's gone out .
and the other parts of the world do n't take this , but more like .
and therefore we 're also the conflict that we see from , ukraine in which is , afghanistan , wherever you look at a look at the maps of american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is there were very colorful , which means , there are many resources where the <unk> the world are .
so if we use as messy as though , then we have to the subject on afterwards .
so we need to change , the ecological limits what we 're everywhere , the <unk> 's everywhere .
and that which we can look at <unk> live here 's not <unk> .
that 's kind of mahatma gandhi , were as he said , he said , the world has enough for everybody needs , not for everybody greed .
and there we , like us here on average life on a lot about .
so .
this was the kind <unk> part .
but i think about the world that you the needs to understand it 's worth it also , what to change .
even when i later going to say , it 's worth it also like so , the way you live in which is more livelihood levels .
but it 's kept going to say , from the <unk> <unk> you need to be a sample , 'that ' i time .
so , which is actually a livelihood , ?
and so we have been shown that we in our face of sharing the world is much as we have reached the economically , astounding in the quality , at the standard of yet us on average , often not comfortable .
here 's a pretty bad mood , but there are people , and you know certain kind of people that 's not so good deal with this story .
i once wrote down .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we work too much and your grazing .
this is on the one hand , we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy .
and on the other cause we saw this <unk> .
but what 's got a good life ?
how we can be defined ?
now here 's kind of a young scientists , break .
well that which i had before i 've said , and what i later tell you 'll let 's scientific , as valid , but here is it gets the same ai , how can i sort of the first of defined ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
the lives in the aspect of the objective conditions as it 's my story , what i 'm going to eat up .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i was a relationship , i can not alive to participate ?
but also , how it gets me with how to go of myself to manage it ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i two concepts in new , at the most important to work .
this one is the needs .
the needs are quite fundamental level of our human flourishing , our there 's hear it ai to feelings .
if we need to fix them , then we 're happy .
and needs of you ca n't say , desires are sustainable , or not sustainable .
human need per se 're not yet to <unk> .
what 's needs ?
you can tell various researchers have to quote , i 'm just two sides called .
and there are the course , the physical model , but also need for safety , for social relations .
for protection , for participation , after <unk> , for creativity , to spirituality , for freedom .
but this has a little thing with money to do .
but to a lot of just not actually , but the question is , how can i 've done in my life that looks .
and i got the second important philosophical terminology .
the strategies .
the strategy that i 'm using the me to there is available to me that needs to meet .
and there 's hear it goes on its bells , that i can say , with a high <unk> or a very low <unk> do .
because i can not much money you need to be a little money you need .
strategies that are just saw my behavior like me in my needs <unk> .
this did with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i have .
if i little money to have to push ' i lost my needs to try to meet as if i was making much money on account .
it 's going to the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then we speak about the <unk> .
and here 's hear it 's when drum , that can use more or a little <unk> , it can kind of sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies , the me to apply to make my needs to satisfy to summarize , then we talk about one of life .
so .
this was the kind of paper then break .
and now it 's drum at what we can do ?
how about how does it ?
and there was just some clues .
obviously got this as well , for themselves will find .
but the evidence on the individual cell type on a technological way , here is , believe that ' i , a lot also about engineering , talking been , and finally , also on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , the beginning we have to speak , i said , the danger is that we speak at more affluence , more resources that use .
after the quality of the slowing down , because also the effects , always gets you 're going to say , and on us in the end user back to beat .
or , if we manage to speak out into another way to go up with less <unk> , you might have fewer consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , may recognize him some , <unk> of <unk> the talk about this <unk> , so much better life with less <unk> .
because it 's a lot about technology like i can see every single thing that we 'll use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the car , the traffic , how can i like this unit ?
and cement , i can today , unlike coal production , i could the house like woodworking machine , the slope .
in order to significantly less <unk> more or the same quality of making .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> did n't that means , the <unk> per <unk> , and then we 're at the , what 's also now have ever been talking has been , because it 's very deep going to get away from businesses to look .
where are actually the needs ?
those services , i can actually fix it ?
and how can i do with a little as possible <unk> do ?
and it 's not with a bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there are many examples of this kind of you can .


this in essence of wood has .
that you , if you might not in fifty years , no longer need to break down , and then again in its parts and not speak , so as much less oscillate , with everything else , along comes out there , in the moment with the side and the goal is with a fifth of <unk> , all over the age of the house designed by this one fifth of <unk> long .
it -- but also a lot in our own , say , how <unk> ' i 'm really ?
elena <unk> has a wonderful book written , <unk> .
where he shows , how hard it in the end is like really the found out of the kind of the treadmill come out .
the <unk> , i want to me say , to stand for other people come up , and then i 'm sort of them forever , in this in this race in .
you which has sort of entitlement , the i was very satisfied , and then pick ' i think this new .
most beautiful of love ' i the <unk> , that you know about all .
when i my department , i 've started doing some years ago we 're still have letter writing .
then you have to speak , wait to be able to the letter back to write ' i ai email , is this ai massive <unk> .
this code . ' i hundreds of emails .
and i can be much longer afford .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we get right back to it .
but i did n't really time it saved .
i 'm concerned with nothing done .
but there 's good example , slow food for instance where i really sort of the claim the quality and the claim of <unk> in the foreground of the classroom .
and with a small <unk> much better life create .
one of my favorites is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling book now you have chairs that this ai n't a regular person with us in germany , in austria , about 10,000 , things at home .
you can you 'll start to count .
if you have two years ago , three generations , tens of things had , having employees , computing .
they get us who managed dissent .
we need to find ourselves in order to deal .
and more people come to make sure , with all options .
and we need a guides , the helps us out , of us out <unk> with these few things in the interest .
only one of land . ' i found interesting , maybe is also ai n't use the spaceship , there 's go out , believe that ' i , no , tens of things out .
the next example is use instead they own .
a real construction boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> has to speak about twenty years ago in in alternative , circles , was designed .
in the meantime , use it more people , if you about <unk> thinking .
if you about <unk> thinking .
platforms , business models are just work with that , what about the things that we 've got this beautiful <unk> here , the front of a few hundred years , built were still learning to use and more about the other end to use it 's about the end .
that which even invested an easy to be better benefits .
this is the end , also a question of justice .
i showed you before they kind of like , unequal , that 's take this as a picture , between africa and europe and a a fair world .
so to say that all the same with these resources living things that there 's only then as possible , if we can use less .
and that is just not much better life , because many of us has always been a way too much .
but it 's an important task of the economy , the company , these products , those services , really to provide the we need to look at a great life to do with a much less resources .
last thing that 's also something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you some point at the projections to read , then it 's degree from the oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these projections were coming down <unk> .
it means , yes , a crisis that 's standing on the door to my view , and also a time , what we say , to deal with the economists , we 've talked and so busy people , that is the numbers of austria , you find this is pretty much for all countries growth is going to go down .
and there 's no reason the infinite growth to have to the way that i do this from my youth , from the 1960 years , you know .
in part is pure mathematics of reasons .
one point five percent growth is today , as much of eight percent growth before fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
who are also about where we might ago , and fifty years .
and large , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder and again , eight percent complained .
this one percent is still a lot , so we will be good deal .
but we have to say , to put forward , i mean , not even if we are zero percent growth would which means that yes , a year is exactly how much indeed , and consume and income people like this year .
that we can be investing and so we can work .
this is also why not so wrong , because you these statistics , if you know , the show that growth models is long been ' work with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality goes into a fiscal countries around on this level , on the we are .
and the way , their jobs are even without growth of , and this is not that came close together , like that keeps us from the <unk> and how they 're called notes suggest that will .
this just not true , and then make you also time with the economy on afterwards .
and it comes over and increasingly that are also <unk> as a form or next week , believe that ' i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to begin to unthread that .
already <unk> has now edward <unk> , the day nobel peace in his <unk> so i asked that he said , he said , the good life the good business , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's about the end , and not to not primarily about the returns to create , not primarily about growth to create something for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , also for china , for india there 's the ai n't very different story .
and this will only then we assume that 's also under <unk> , if we have to speak , still growing , me , and we just like , on this level , on this high levels , on the we 're good on life and economies .
that takes a 's also , politics .
it takes three targets .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it does n't just sort of growth , but we should really look and measure and ask , what about when you have the quality , rises up on ?
is the reputation for ?
then we 've also our politicians to measure .
now , what 's the <unk> ?
how does kind of them together ?
we need a basic aspect of mind is , the <unk> finally to tax , and not the work .
who you , especially those entrepreneurs are among them , but also the employees to understand this very good .
what they kind of control the branding , we know all times a fellow paid .
and that could you very differently .
the resources are sort of reduces and therefore we 're in the resources , minus , and not the work .
and you have after all <unk> bring about engagement to create , about pensions to ensure that health , infrastructure , without growth .
this is , but because you have any kind of a little bit hard .
that means to conclude , any one , on all levels do this way to work will , we can be hard , we can be an enterprise with the products , services as a consumer sort of we might wonder what we need are actually , who do that what 's kind of good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the right political change , the framework for a hard .
some clues as i 've given .
and the end of course also the science <unk> percent of science is still in the direction , how do this growth and stimulate job ?
it has , but nobody had arrived .
if you the projections look if you the development can look at the last 20 years , it 's always look , because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the science is not going to create , but this is the question how do we do with the order , which case that we a good life of them have ?


with heart , the brain , your hand , and the end , including the spirit into , we need .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
this city has many stories to tell .
one of them up with a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving and i 'll go right , and on the story about later .
they 're going to do with the citadel <unk> .
this is this ai <unk> , the here in the center that city , says , and lots of this city , also makes us , informing us .
another story about earlier .
it was on a hot summer in to reno and , nevada .
a man knows , like at once in his shoes that 's true that it right <unk> .
that 's starting to it 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he makes a result of put the shoe of taking a knife <unk> not too long sting in , which is a few times makes you have a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , back to be there be a knifing a way and notice he is a new climate change in shoe .
it 's the shoe , it 's breathing , born .
and this number of you see here is the point in the forbes list of these billionaires are at the morton <unk> today .
a company is <unk> born , with four letters .
the or another one of you know it .
he 's the original idea nike even and adidas are offered .
both have died .
so he says , well , <unk> , i go back in my own business .
<unk> it going on the stock market .
we 're preoccupied with several thousand people in six hundred of businesses in about <unk> the world .
so much on creative problem-solving .
why not something to reinvent , what else is not here ?
and mario question is perhaps the question that are about <unk> shortcut the leaves .
if you <unk> n't know , it stands for what is that was an opportunity ?
this question that 's got me already been helpful , in tough situation .
if something gone wrong is , or my collaborator heralds me or engineering n't work or whatever .
<unk> , small brain region , <unk> .
what is that was an opportunity ?
and before you get from <unk> into <unk> .
what that might do <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and another example , supplies of the franc <unk> collected , which is the <unk> statements all of <unk> .
and the evidence , as imaginative people who can be , if it build their own insurance does .
let me some examples here .
the so they are actually so that action in the franc <unk> and who has to take it also an ad .
i love ' the amazing .
my son has the woman 's not <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , this is the woman from the <unk> <unk> .
or i had all day , plants actually elected as i the intersection had arrived , grew into a bush in my vision and i could this other vehicles do n't see more .
clearly , who this guilt is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two out nearly died .
there are able to me , but at least that half <unk> payoff .
last thing i was at the crash , do n't blame .
debt was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is each other statement that anymore .
if you know , but a woman who are , you know it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream that what we all over a very fond of creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't have to be like this .
why not things just do differently ?
old one of things that we do , the routine have gotten that we might start with bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why are not just do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , the use this .
for example <unk> , who have yet these <unk> of her pick up , these signs , or on the wall , for example , and there then maybe that kind of the worst .
well as a way , right ?
let 's the coffee order to stay away to <unk> .
or something like .
we have no , wifi , <unk> you .
is probably already today regular experience , right ?
if you the phone , not anything to give you can .
or eat them with me , because of starvation , we both .
rude , but as creative .
well , it takes away .
i play . ' one of the client or environment where the truth and swipe and i go and say , okay , that i like .
this <unk> ' i out .
a german <unk> has one should do the current day <unk> , which is in <unk> .
once the sport , once the global news , once upon politics .
if you have three times on the pot , which is you <unk> .
even got the complaint about too long <unk> at dinner .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all the hands are committed to do .
it was too close .
they 're thinking , collectively , what we do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we can not faster than getting into the kitchen .
the following idea is created .
in any room will actually killing <unk> <unk> putting the fresh olive oil , salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so , that over the environment in the waiting to get away from eating your <unk> ever known themselves that hits you could .
just different .
a creative thinking , and maybe even with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person who does represent not only unpopular .
you this person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and currently <unk> yes , the german orbit .
in the second day , it continues to go and monday , so four days .
a company has already vastly <unk> to the staff of the month 's chosen , and you know , maybe it , which .
a <unk> says , rather than a vastly , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .
the bus is full , it 's <unk> run , people to organize themselves in the carpool , because each of course , after the other ways that we found out of the a point b to come .
but why do n't they also tend to be something we use , and creatively from losing something to do ?
sometimes going on the creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> perhaps , like with this company , that you may .
so we 've probably know that there are at the <unk> n't really goes well , but that they were at the <unk> and even save you need is something worry .
or at <unk> in the car .
because we know , yes , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why do n't be a piece bacon and the car starts hanging , if you <unk> there ?
or at <unk> it 's also have to the creative to build .
and all this has to do just with humor , with enjoyment which , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son with me in the office .
and sitting on this <unk> me .
so , we couple of the <unk> around the <unk> .
and then turning sand comes from left to right , he 's delight , and i in my stupid <unk> distinctiveness of the way of you to stop , well that 's not a playground here .
it to me , looked at me , big eyes , but , the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i 'm actually he 's right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground ?
why is that , what we do n't the playground for grown-ups ?
the only one of all of a lot of urgency , right ?
if we are relaxed i mean , if we our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and so as excellence in the field , but there 's just lazy .
this curious about is that , if a particular day , the week is coming then is changing what in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow it 's our focus on a different day .
so another day , we usually prefer them .
so in the weekend .
this sounds you know , even just in the media .
on thursday 's called `` yes , just a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year , announced that 's going to the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's feeling so ?
we have all so awful as jobs ?
a <unk> had this time to report of barrels , this topic .
yeah , a monday , could ' i and the rest of life , you ask ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook , over the social networks to talk about this has taken .
once <unk> i through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
it 's a lot of business and i took me to talk about .
what have the way in the <unk> which there 's true ?
and one day , stuck , i 'm in this business with these signs of to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , well that 's quite nicely .
so , of with so i love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that well , my father of five kids , but i love with my work anymore .
yes .
or still working for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that their attitude about this is this plays , which is increasingly , and keep it .
anybody got a few times as an answer to this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it 's your job .
and i ask even in fact , with the pink , glasses , here , forward to come and say , okay , make bees ' time a shift .
what my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , though it 's the pink , glasses , is , it 's equal everything from like before .
so something nice to talk to do n't this is beautiful , it works , obviously not .
the pink , glasses , it 's actually great for a bike ride .
there 's what you a wonderful , the flies off , who else in your land it would .
but to <unk> advice that they do n't .
where is us that , if we do n't change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside the more self-sufficient .
it ends , maybe into a system where we like us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this cycle , and running and running and running , and eventually gets to quickly , this cycle , it was hit the poor mouse and they will tip out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know you know anything else , you go back to change in the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the film and every day acknowledges me , the <unk> you know it might happen , i think you know , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so you can be yes , because failure and it goes over and again , so there .
and that which we as funny and i 'll probably has the mouse , some point of concussion , yeah ?
or whatever takes away , that <unk> <unk> .
i felt many years ago , so i went out there was from a seminar home .
and on time i turned out that way down underneath me , felt it turned black , my face and somehow got ' i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , so what ?
he looked me and said , the way that 's physically , everything in order .
but as well look about the <unk> from ?
and i looked into my calendar , to bring that test , and saw , i started three weeks , through and somehow bugging me also the job .
after two decades into the <unk> and collaborator , the first in the early on wonder whether we 're at night before the end you can do .
i thought the same , what is it actually what else to jobs ?
and i 've begun to <unk> , the other priorities and set , who look at that i time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me , which i 'm doing .
<unk> ' , if you could n't get it ai n't other <unk> there in my job , a new spark off .
i realized , the talks about a large groups who make me really joyful .
i go ' to do with counseling and seminars and other things , but these sessions . pulses of us to be allowed to experience to share , who prepare me really joyful .
and this was n't always the way .
i 've got myself recognizing there must realize that <unk> stress sick .
and sometimes need it properly taken this shot off the front so , <unk> of me that 's degree away from the hospital been released , after he 's a heart attack i had and at once he starts to be able to <unk> .
sooner than i said , a chance you do jogging , he 's me still <unk> , yes , you with your running around .
now it 'll find ourselves .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but eventually we will also a common theme running out .
what happens ?
the bottom we all become more healthy .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the rise , is the conditions , because of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the <unk> last 10 years , <unk> pretty negative fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is shrinking .
the rise of psychiatric disorders plus eight centuries from one percent .
this is something , where i think , you have this to be ?
why is that ?
this is just in austria , like ?
no , even in germany , it 's like .
<unk> , <unk> , that everything becomes more healthy .
this is so here on the left to recognize .
the bottom up mental illness in three plus eight hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> psychiatric drugs out at .
also the cost .
and it look at all kinds of formal , what we can do with this subject ?
do n't have suggestions , sometimes come to be able to find out , involuntary <unk> , like for example here .
so it 's great effect .
and somebody once said , no alcohol abuse is no solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that which us , but again , healthy the power and fulfilling and with enjoyment which brings me ?
and now i was the last year and busy .
i wondered , it 's sort of the <unk> , can get something like all be ?
i 'm figure this , the job is not that which we <unk> fulfilling and happy to do .
there are many things that are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact , but that we the most of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do so , then why does n't pretend that it 's got joy of pain and also makes other .
the <unk> <unk> ' i 'm going <unk> '' as the last point to provide the way to <unk> and to <unk> that .
these little shortcuts to be thought , hopefully go easier to understand that .
<unk> he said the talent and execution , liberty and environment .
i mean , how <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in what surroundings do ' i mean , with whom ?
the freedom was ' i 'm here , to do this , what i want to do ?
because it 's the amount of the <unk> , of us <unk> .
the more about the more stress .
and what i do it ?
the execution .
that are these four areas .
and it is anyone for themselves to test .
i had this for me , which i check a few years and i do that 's routinely the time .
can feel for talents to use ?
in what the environment ?
and i mean , sometimes leave me in a cafe by my laptop to the seminar ready or a <unk> .
the freedom .
the freedom , can i think about to do this , what it 's important .
and do i do it also ?
the execution .
the last ted u .
and then there 's it keeps people to me to explain why does n't go .
and why do with them is more difficult .
then i usually just like an answer this is where .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't have reasons .
and ideally , at the spot , you get around , pick love ' i ways to pick ' i think about roads or draw on ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both are right .
what we do so with our talent ?
each of you have his great <unk> service .
that 's the way too small .
that 's filled with the same talent , using gold , with all , with their skills .
what do it ?
ideally , for the end we ask this .
or if we in hospital close or end of a life .
what i did with my talent doing ?
the way , who here 's got fed up on <unk> <unk> , can do afterwards that there 's available .
so , what do with our talent , is so my first question , well let me , ourselves , which every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
so i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i look at the point they 're doing .
the fortress which was the salvation of the <unk> ago when <unk> five hundred years , the hostiles were coming .
and the enemy to feel that the fortress is basically built was that you do n't take the way .

i was <unk> time .
so i thought about the following , okay if we do n't get , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no longer system and pure .
let 's how long . '' this is that there , goodness .
the <unk> thought it from long till the day came , where the stock up with most consuming these caves .
they 're just a <unk> 's been on the way by slaughtering become more than the <unk> into the bishop says , the bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you test , i <unk> ' boy , come to hold your <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to the <unk> way .
at once look down the enemies , how about the wall of the fortress is a <unk> will be dragged is led to keep going from left side and already in the early .
well , you think that , a <unk> which is that .
it 's at noon .

enemies , you think , oh , who has two more <unk> , it can '' another thing , how much .
at night the same scene and again , this time is he knows the <unk> , the there , and down is led .
the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> 've seen the bottom , they pulled into a <unk> off .
because they thought , that takes us too long , that we hold your own work out .
then we 've got the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , the they had and the you <unk> have .
it 's the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea that all right there is what we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes it 's it narrowed resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's much .
but you can use it 's what do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have -- the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then they 're right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know how far away the snow turns out gets warm for catching the plants and sort of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there are blooms eventually come from those blooms fruits .
there are apple here 's very popular ones and then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain could we will grind it makes bread for baking .
there any animals , the thing to eat .
there 's people who then the products just turn into later , food .
and it 's automatically .
but when you think about that may not so anyway , everything is it 's a fear and so anxious .
and obviously this is this problem and maybe just very ambiguous and also be game theoretically , but just in the realm of these blooms of the connection of the petal of the plant , play the bees , a very , matter much .
there 's research that shows that to <unk> percent of our food , of certain foods really not there were , if we do n't make bees had .
well this sounds like <unk> at because it 's natural for us is , and we 're bees might not that sense .
there was now while back as a very interesting movie , <unk> , on .
and i recommend you , look at it .
now , but for allowing us on the lord <unk> the fact , just embarked on bees are working , the in his sweetheart , in <unk> the importance of bees can do .
that he doing here at a school at <unk> and it gets us now good thing about his work with it .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
once a big thank you look , mr. <unk> and all that <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> contribute something you can think about this are the bees .
and that 's also under a wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell the fun .
because i suppose it okay , that most of you <unk> active are we would be here tonight is a <unk> do you in eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in new to meet .
that do i do n't , no .
but maybe do you get me , you to get that they are <unk> start to love or a kind of empathy that let me to develop and you to engage with this <unk> true , <unk> , including the bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young when i 'm with an incredible wife , married , father of five kids were n't <unk> and i have different <unk> and curriculum finished and working since <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm involved in <unk> <unk> and in the association <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our eldest people whose students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play by <unk> <unk> and about <unk> <unk> .
we 're flying classroom is more than a peaceful , a quiet , a quiet thing .
and they will be able to rest .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not for naught if we 've been on the ancient greeks the relationship of honey and so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> known .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping poet you run around him to inspire , it to go back with dense information can .
but the <unk> go there 's not myself down , but they send your mission blue , bees and <unk> now the denser the lips like to wax and we crawl in the mouth in and back out with him later , the words like the honey from <unk> fall .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully will this to me tonight .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , this <unk> the room now my students with me , we have built up for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> into school or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms around us in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied going to me in the class , which we 're a animates place for such a <unk> .
most of the window through the children 's something can see during this month .
and in front of all things , with the bees , the then there are by the tubing coming back and <unk> can .
there is then the window on a cell and created .
so .
and then you start a whole thing with me on the <unk> .
i 'm so a <unk> and jump , '' now from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you now here in that 's <unk> inside .

also important , we have here <unk> migrate north , and here has at the perimeter around for fresh migrate to be so fresh eggs .
and then indeed also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey is inside .
the need them , if there 's worst weather is , and they 're not able to fly .
so .
looks like this is go out .
there 's the <unk> see again on and begins immediately the transportation depended on the reason we <unk> places , or at the reason we <unk> place in school .
and now starting an amazing thing .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there are then in the class are experiencing a sudden a crisis .
their people 's no longer .
they are lonely .
you find your queen did n't .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he made this <unk> care products that he happy to pay attention that the queen , in ancient people , i 'm left .
that are not so on both these <unk> auditorium .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they start to roaring .
yes , the <unk> says , they are roaring .
you hear that .
they sound of almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen to live together .
and now starting a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in one night , they 're developing now , the need to a new people start circles , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without looking at conferences , without having conversations , without wisdom and the positions .
there is the people who agreed , and form to go into the first night , there , a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this nation after six weeks , no longer exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and at that the first night , get them from this <unk> a pin it out an egg , and bring this in this <unk> inside .
and then hooked would you ai at the queen going .
everybody , the of you <unk> in the high had to tell you look like this is because they go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , is all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now starting an amazing thing .
this egg , what 's normally in the <unk> a worker who have would be in the <unk> a queen .


you know this concept .
and immediately is changing on this <unk> on <unk> ask the genetic code .

that we had before you have ever heard that , what we eat , that determines , what we will .
and the queen is that really wonderful to see .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .

you see that in class .
and then becomes this cell <unk> with a porous wax into the whole thing happens then also not , because at the nation , where democratic , that decision , because one <unk> says , so it 's supposed to be , or you republican back a group saying , you do this now .
no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or a <unk> a resolution .
and then count the students to eight days of my student knows , three , five times eight a queen 's doing so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if that then , so we should happen , the teacher is that wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> at the students in the morning about five o'clock , yes .
and then he says the mother , 'that 's , which is because with you go ?
yes , i need to school .
yes , why that one ?
yes , your queen <unk> .
yes ?
and then there are the morning at six in school .

and if you really that can experience then they stop at first thing .

so .
even a little bit higher .
and then the <unk> and cut the queen going free .
the first , what the queen , they spread her wings come and there are now with their <unk> that people what to put yourself a queen i pulled that has its smell , you <unk> , they think of pheromones .
the nation has now , then an identity .
now are three or five days for the queen and sure .

comes up behind the bat droppings out , from people , from this <unk> .
and after five days going to the queen is unique way off <unk> out .
others think now , yes , i 've ever seen , such a <unk> in <unk> .
you know , stop .
what different .
-- that allow us .
the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without the guards , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
they 'd ever seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and will be here in an initial <unk> now <unk> , from seven or twelve drones , the kind of bees .
so it backwards as in islam , where the man , different women have allowed this is the queen , the seven or twelve men .
and it 's happening in a wonderful way in midair .
the drone along comes from behind <unk> the queen , and the queen , what happens now in this initial mating all this , what you get those seeds will need to three years to lay eggs .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
if they finished with this <unk> you kill them and the dead by the sky .
and there 's the queen and back , and starts , to lay eggs .
there are always a , two students in the class , the that immediately see .
the way too busy changing the queen .
yes .

and then come , i one night , then managed to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> from outside , and the next morning jump , ' i believe that <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there 's where you also see the queen .
yes .
it 's fresh <unk> .
and around , often than 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then come yes , these two <unk> get right now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a particular prey and now is that people the big and hard .
why are bees in school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that have experienced , forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not only thing , in this class , then the students , with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes , in this class . ok .
and the teacher , when he could n't know , if he 's something can , if he 's when he was doing something , threw in the can a history , and after the other and join .
and look at the bees and this ai <unk> ago <unk> years we have a cave , where people on the honey and you harvest .
on a few months , you have in israel schools , years old <unk> located where people then the bees for sticking out .
any human culture has to bees lived together .
or vice versa , the bees were at any culture out .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece in rome .
wherever they were doing .
the human culture , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , have passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know what plants or through the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that they go out there 's worth anything you find , now in summer in agriculture .
this is out , that 's a green desert for honeybees .
yes ?
he can touch with the students in the tastings go and flowers are bees are generating plants , at <unk> you mark and look , how long need to have now from <unk> to my kids pollinating plants ?
how long , they 're on the individuals are blooms ?
and how long , they need to go back .
he does this ai <unk> this right .
how <unk> i 'm a hexagon ?
yes .
so you know whether that 's so that in the <unk> the top for the top is n't it ai n't flat side up is ?
you look carefully .
he 's a mathematics -- which is a <unk> join .
yes , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , he can use to students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and it goes to the question , how could karl from scratch <unk> the nobel prize , ever get ?
because he thought , it does that the bees that look at the beehive .
but , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
one 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , the many years in <unk> at the university in teaching has been <unk> to discover that the bees are playing out a <unk> create a single <unk> .
as a <unk> network of the wax into <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , in their <unk> there as light , and the bees , the <unk> , the reconnecting with their legs , with their <unk> .
now , what these bees in school ?
it 's <unk> par excellence , and the kids lose your afraid of the bees .
and develop a care for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , thereby , what the bees do .
and they get a warning about these creatures which basically just for us human lives .
the bees do to wax not even a half pounds per people in the year .
in front <unk> years , the only way , and candles that you create .
they accumulate in the budding and outside of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , to fix them their people out .
and now i think of the time ago , in summer , that are sixties -- which <unk> bees on such a narrow set space , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 're infectious diseases , without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they brought in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and therefore , that it can ferment , he 's going to <unk> , a level <unk> .
someone who at the <unk> disease is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go to be a <unk> dedicated to make , putting it 's the <unk> from people <unk> .
obviously there 's a grid , before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so forth , because it does n't happen .
yes , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , and pollinating the <unk> do that the bees , obviously also , and we have a few apples , if the bees . i could n't fly would or we 'd like chinese is happening on the <unk> <unk> and they themselves and pollinating plants .
there 's much larger context .
look at the <unk> , out there on the pasture , is also the growing up to pastures or , where the cows graze again .
and there are flying the bee up to get their nectar and it 's fermented and that <unk> .
and now comes the cow and eats the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> electroencephalogram , they can digest .
yes ?
and then <unk> she goes back and notice , oh yeah . i 've <unk> <unk> , ah , i can come back <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yes ?
and finally , this gives the bee of us the most valued , what it on the from nature , there .
the honey .
i want more quickly to the point is a way , <unk> .
my students celebrate the each year , if you that <unk> build and then some of my work in the schools and go .
that 's going to do n't mean <unk> but once i had a student of and then i said in <unk> in college in <unk> and have said , you , <unk> ' carts and you find ourselves .
and then he says , yes , so , i hot . '' <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> at <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and since two years when thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm excited . ' me that i 'm no longer with the <unk> have to learn , but with my hands can learn .
<unk> , yes , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , and hit a secondary school .
and more than half of said , oh yeah , that we want to do .
my students see here a huge priority , and the barrier between , in quotes that normal and the <unk> people get through the bees , salvaged .
on the field just spend your knowledge and they will develop self-esteem , my students and a certain amount of pride .
why do you to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you would say , why do you to <unk> the <unk> ?
and then i think ' i , but there 's the person , the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , i lead with .
the end of a little verse of <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun across the <unk> feel the way to flower will find it was never the way to lose the sides of the fields in <unk> glamour as quickly he also lived , he would hardly be crying .
thank you .
hello , my friends on earth .
so welcome to talk about my project .
this project of my first person and my wife .
it 's the fight for an end of the female genital mutilation .
in my view the greatest crimes of man , because it <unk> been five thousand years .
the society against the women who still a thousand to sacrifice every day .
first <unk> ' i imagined .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there , i <unk> years a <unk> run .
you can imagine that i 'm the job , not <unk> .
i felt i do n't <unk> .
so , i was happy that i 'm in the theme <unk> good <unk> and exciting done pull back .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> about the news about africa , after brazil .

it was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet been such as a huge amounts of goodness , that interest in the media to find and even a small person as i could express your concerns the world to the language of us .
<unk> i was to relate to the caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia eras in .
then there was there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we have a bystander at the killings , there .
and all the cruelty , that we were experiencing , we saw on the other side of the infinity hospitality of <unk> , the us that appeared <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted them and our two guards who you see here , with their bodies as living <unk> before us <unk> , and the <unk> said that 's my environment .
if you the killing you want to get their way around us through it converts .
something like i was in any other cultures , i found .
and then in were young already learned that you islam is not can reduce to terrorism .
well , christian feels like it’s not be reduced to get from terrorism .
for example of <unk> .
the inquisition , the <unk> .
but rather on the true value of charity , social responsibility , the <unk> .
this is the values , for the way it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i look at this <unk> been the combined with my wife <unk> .
and since then we go from this <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i stopped that , nine-tenths of the daily victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> 'em . ' i thought about how can a <unk> like the muslim , up alongside that 's most of terror has been shown that even <unk> in the shoes , push now ?
and the idea was born in the top leaders of islam to get the need to sin to explain .
we were looking for the comrades in german organizations who did n't we found .
so let 's talk to go back now we would be yes , perhaps completely <unk> , the muslim was n't <unk> .
you would i the throat ribbons .
on <unk> of amnesty , and internationally , we 've got <unk> our own conservation organization we started .
and they were of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and now to this battle has ever come to do we had visuals .
it was a scarcity .
and therefore we moved <unk> and i went back in this desert in order to hidden camera , these pictures to do .
the bad gory images that i show you know , but i want to briefly that crime , drawing .
girl at age four weeks to the point marriages are some point of their parents and allies , picked , the planet , put you sit on the limbs , and cut them even before anesthesia , the clitoris of the <unk> down -- stitches on a <unk> the <unk> to , even before anesthesia in attendance instruments , without knowing of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> can attenuate this .
what you that 's a cell and the size of a <unk> .
<unk> is : well , a few minutes .
if they typically get , and hurting were two weeks .
inconceivable and ruins your body and soul which has deprived their dignity .
that the beginning was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> it gets further .
the man has to open it .
he has ever been a <unk> woman has seen .
the uncle , have thought he said , oh , like ibrahim , but that 's no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis on <unk> a and then you stub your serious .
and if you it 's not talented , which is also not bad .
then <unk> you that knife and <unk> you on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
that dies a third of the girls .
that you had three months ago mutilated .
in shock is a girl language -- lose .
this is the <unk> , even some in asia .

and whenever we are muslims can ask , why you 've done ?
i was the <unk> answer , that we need to do , this is at the koran .
nothing written in the koran always , quite the opposite .
everybody , believing <unk> times per day in prayer , like this is unheard of allah , the creator , which is imperfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , so what you pray .
they assume , allah , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why you just as <unk> human so prepotent could , on women <unk> .
but now we had the images of the first of cymatics had the sultan .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there was hard and discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then came the great decision , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to ban them .
as recently that 's the way the sultan this new <unk> signed .
and you put africa and the <unk> know , known to just that has to these people are valid .
and it was being celebrated , and these successes , we had then also in other countries .
quick example , again , in mauritania in there <unk> us the highest spiritual , the <unk> of his message that 's a crime is , on the banner , to write and so in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were traveling , with my own camels .
a hundred banner , we had the process .
and where we concluded , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality of experiences .
and when we do this country gets to rely on was , said , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , will you 're really all <unk> countries operate ?
so much lifetime will , allah , you 're not .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and because you have been slow to deal .
and in particular , he had an idea .
he said , if you like it succeeds , the ten <unk> muslims at the world at a table to put the reason for the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew over cairo , in the <unk> and -- the mosque incommensurable with the vatican , is almost maniacally .
and when <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened to the idea of was thrilled , in particular , when we have his notion that we finance this would .

and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not just <unk> , as we would think about asking you had , but i 'm going to the <unk> away .
and that he 'd done .
over cairo <unk> sometime in <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to ban the <unk> of female parts of your body through cut .
under the <unk> of <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all these are coming .
a hundred guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and in the rest of europe , he 's the cause of <unk> because of the caricatures .
so men who live and death can decide .
but also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about where i 'll ask <unk> me , just a vacuum ago , allah , personally .
and then i did you all that greets you .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of my wife , mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much on , of islam is not <unk> .
we had some doctors , load of their way we 'll <unk> , anything terrible , you women 's particularly on which <unk> .
and then you could <unk> your film shows , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they moved to come back behind closeted kind of doors for only two hours , you had decided , and one , fatwa , writing , a <unk> .
the <unk> jumps off the cameras , announced , what you vote .
and the most important set up , it was this .
female genital mutilation , is a <unk> crime , this is by high value of islam is telling .
he autograph the , fatwa .
we thought , the job is done had , but the calculus , without our the hosts .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to speak , is the company has remained as any mind .
so we <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden book .

and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it just thought , the book , he 's it with a `` co was blessed .
it gets us from the hands of rent .
we were in many countries had put conferences , `` given to the per acre than clergy like .
and they read this with interest in some were so thrilled that they do this book i 'd kissed a problem .
unfortunately , but have the most not the courage attached to this is also to announce that .
over the abdomen , the wife gets to do n't in the mosque to talk .
just some of the courage upset .
they 're at least in the universities are a little , on the squares .

and then it out of speakers in the <unk> .
and this is yes , the subjects .
the will spread .
but i 'm running out of time .
it 's all drop in the hot rocks , and so i 'm working in many other strategy , this issue more <unk> .
the need to stop .
but my <unk> this would have this .
i want to the great message the highest clergy who the world . announce the birthplace of islam actually here on the kaaba , in mecca .
not in such <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there are four million people together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all those and the <unk> master of my transparent up there between the minarets in contract .
as i think that here ever had trained to put in the <unk> .
unfortunately , i 've not even the last <unk> be done the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> , he would join .
one of those women to help .
for others to the world time to show you which the true value of islam is , there are always present to try .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't create , then <unk> ' i might this , what in hamburg , launching his way .

and we transparent , in the contract , could .
and maybe i experience i see if you that little girl puts his daughters , no longer <unk> needs .
then , up my life that really worth it .
and i want to calling about every one that this idea now has seen or has to join me .
so did n't be part is an <unk> .
we need to practice in the ton of entering , because i kick the one of this stage n't realize that .
and now , i want to conclude the concept of my <unk> before you .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down here we have it will also in german .
female genital mutilation about the koran , and the ethic of islam , incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i go ahead of this time .
so we looked at the <unk> out that you as a refugee camps in germany would get .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first such a package <unk> .
it tasted faintly <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't know why the us now a rotten dinner gave you have .
third day , we were actually resolved .
we stood on trash , they wanted this stuff back to throw then came a <unk> wife and trade that easy to <unk> out .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not spoiled food .
it tastes like a very good .
it 's the cheese .
my mom took the brow and if we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , we 've had a very <unk> but the 's not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
15 years ago , i 'm with my mother and my brother of china to germany fled .
of those rats between <unk> ' i 'm telling .
but all about it , i 'm trying to the people would those rats between these people who have and to a success did .
but before the bat '' i 'm going to where i just come .
i 'm <unk> .
uyghurs are a little <unk> , the northwest of china 's life .
and this is the region of the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> kilometers from germany away .
in china to live in general -- 10 million uyghurs but in munich , is the biggest <unk> community outside of china .
and the uyghurs and life , so here because we in china under constant abuses of suffering .
hundreds of chinese were extra for <unk> moved so we in our own home to a minority have gotten .
our own native language , <unk> turned out of education system to crowd .
in schools and in university will have only chinese students .
and our religion and we ca n't have free to act .
the uyghurs and lose that their culture and identity .
and if any brave , and for the right the uyghurs use cancer risk large sentences , torture , even die .
it was also the reason that my parents looking for you 've decided , with us kids to escape .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is just before our rats between form .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time to leave .
i <unk> ' at me , many people to look at the run have helped .
i <unk> ' at me , many images .
i <unk> ' me , but first of <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i committee , '' it just before me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had this ai <unk> to increase and we met him and up with their little lada on a parking space .
the first rate was to vomit .
i know that lots of a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business to refugees abuse and they 're not for the fates to care .
but i <unk> ' say , i <unk> of this a <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> has us for months were traveling .
he stood on the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last end of looked like , we also really safe from the <unk> came .
airport in <unk> so we then on , and i remember , as my mother got to me saying goes straight out of the airport .
is that i 'm not about .
until we out there are .
because i 'd say are in my hand a stamp and there was also my photo in here , but there was an alien name , <unk> .
i had a <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' at me <unk> <unk> the me , aha ! he had to stamp my in my hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we had finally <unk> .
in munich , came <unk> ' i look at a lot of the first responders , the us kind of big supporter of .
i <unk> ' at me the <unk> woman who inspire us in <unk> used to produce .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least a guideline , children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was stranger who 's faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> parts .
there was eating , sex and done homework .
friends and they 're not to visit , because i <unk> , where we live .
just my <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> knew i mean .
they knew my story and ostensibly in me , and you care around me .
for example , she brought me to <unk> <unk> what i 'm not anymore to do .
but that helped me , kind of german peers were to meet .
i spent all my adolescence in <unk> .
it was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with our children with her husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had the only a different factions , and we could access deported .
i <unk> ' i remember that i 'm very , aggressively , was the time .
it 's my little bit embarrassed , the right now everything to tell you need now i just to my story starts .
i was extremely aggressive and i made me in school as bad way to focus .
the taking us in the first to the catholic <unk> where we first time to get kids in contact with .
by normal , my ' i kids who are not in a <unk> live had .
i <unk> ' i also on the <unk> the me and my brother and at the post-conference or <unk> sent to have .

i <unk> ' i also on several <unk> <unk> the with us done homework done , because our parents did n't a german , we could .
or the have to us just drawn .
we 've always very happy .
i remember , as we 've always before the fence line standing and waited until these people came out , because , sort of took up guard houses , people have our time , and this was looking back to count .
after two years , finally got my father to germany .
this problem was , but that it directly from <unk> after <unk> deported was because it in munich , apparently , no way more for him was .
i <unk> ' at me the very , engaged lawyer improving the it has managed to my father before the <unk> to china to protect us they made it in fact that would look at us in munich a housing for letting me .
i <unk> ' at me this period where i really got very , happy i was , because after six years <unk> allowed to do we finally in a standard place to move .
and we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , a own apartment at your bad '' and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was having a very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i could my door to close .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , yes , very well used up , but i had yet the <unk> without a degree away .
i saw for me really not a perspective .
there was a <unk> , the me in <unk> always been supported by and it 's still going on the idea that i know about the second <unk> my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thanks to the teachers who really at me thought , and i was really not just the time i started to it actually goes to the middle of gcses .
and then i came to <unk> .
and before i <unk> came i played the way through my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> this piece of this i just done because we go through <unk> a place , where we just go off .
we had a valve tube , what we aggression <unk> could .
and the director of <unk> helped us kind of us our problems would tell you could and he was ostensibly in us and i could look at all ask some <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project , where young people without a major in the ability to get off of artistic <unk> .
this did i 'm very well done , and i realized , art is something which i 'm a little bit <unk> .
by <unk> and the touch with <unk> came a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of awards .
we realized that people around for our history of interesting .
he was a very special feeling , because we 've ever experienced was that people look for listening .
and it was a moment , where i thought , okay .
i want to work <unk> .
i want something from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees from me on the idea for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join me .
but since i in the bold building i 'm totally run a plane i happened in a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one or four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and the good thing is that after a performance , two editors , from <unk> broadcasting , on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i 've had just your <unk> to do .
i said , super , the golden ticket .
clearly make bees ' i do .
and i did for this program marking <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of my pieces of a play <unk> , where i also known themselves <unk> was for the european <unk> placed .
and i 've also comes to actually won .
now to study i go in grad school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> on the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and it would have to me to do n't have been possible if not individual or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> good to me to apply the best bees .
they have to me believe they have to me spaces were open , they have to me a way out showing how i my place in society , i <unk> can .
and so , eh . ' i 'm going to them .
each of you have the way of people like me to help the second chance to get , and their lives or her place in society to find .
because , the people , in every day come <unk> hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're full of hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they do with great determination of her many terrible producer of hurdles that behind them to leave .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany would be and for each of us too .
and i could actually thousands of things tell , what you can do , but since i could n't enough time i 've even though there , a minute , 40s , i put them a <unk> brought .
extended , they 're putting your cellphone out , you ca n't tell me tell them to be no code , scan human nature .
we scan them , the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities , what you what can do .
and that would look quite well , help .
i thank you and i 've ever known for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan them , the code .
i committee , '' it .
many of the phone , not in my hand .
you are so i 'm grown , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .

'm willing for us to connect people .
my name is a robin .
my <unk> 's going to be easier than it may speak .
i come , '' of austria , this is in vienna .
i 'm excited . ' i still very , today in <unk> be lucky to be , is really beautiful here .
i <unk> me here every time , very well .
and it’s not a phrase , this is a sense .
yes , yes , as opposed to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , if you about anything to <unk> .
i could tell you could n't talk .
but it 's so that i 'm writing , i write in my spare and this is go somewhere having sex pistols ' , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just events like the world today .
yes , and i was also today i asked , some of the text to read , the order to this program a little <unk> .
and that 's just push ' i 'm here do .
yes .
i start with a joke .
together is two chicken .
this tells a so , are two totally familiar with chickens ' <unk> youtube , and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> ever been very funny , i <unk> youtube , and <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
this tells the other , yeah .
he in my dad ca n't <unk> me .
here would we have this level , organized .
the first text is a little <unk> , that i once wrote her up .
i ' that time , one person is devoted to me , you know what has meant .
it carries the title <unk> .
and yes , it 's time , which i do n't understand .
when your head in my lap , was sleeping under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling , your leg that we look outside the ceiling .
my leg that we look for us through the ceiling .
it 's about your head is hold on my lap , dear , the rest of her camping under the ceiling , my leg as well under the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
this has <unk> , when play in my leg is extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the text , i was also then one person is devoted to me a lot of land .
and it 's my grandpa owned .
we 've since no contact .
my <unk> grandfather was from career has a butcher paper .
and also inspired as he teamed up with love <unk> cut .
'm just like , yes .
yes , even 'n text .
better be the not .
jesus is the only the rescuers standing on this sticker for the glass of the bus .
but where jesus was when he painted myself from that sticker <unk> ' save them ?
there to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> already taken ?
soon text .
the next text is slightly longer .
he takes actually a half hours .
so to write .
and read it gets faster .
is beginning of a novel that i degrees in the <unk> code .
ah , it 's about <unk> guy , so the adventure , one guy who are over the hairs , codes -- and a little too much <unk> .
i <unk> ' me , but again and this is where we pay off <unk> i distance .
because i <unk> ' i never the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head , empty .
so low as the sheet , that he now to fill and tried .
yes , etc. , i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people understand it 's not .
i am of myself too hard .
and it 's the really , i think of love with my vocabulary ; and with my language .
i ' time i 'd love with me playing .
and yes , then get hold these things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet , very epic journey .
is probably the <unk> <unk> , that i 've written on 'em .
<unk> we can .
yes , we dosage .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can do it .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , i did the same police did n't understand .
no idea .
yeah , which is applauding in mine from .
i say , ' time , either all right ? none .
the next sheet was also do with text to do .
is something like a little <unk> .
i have made of the time for the insects and writing .
very polite .
yes , even 'n text .
is a little <unk> .
and it 's about something cool , whenever i 'd like , do that you three to say , maybe .
my text that holds the title , all good things are very cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we meet the <unk> .
so we have you stroke , <unk> , <unk> and scraping and he 'll do things better and yes , this is it .
beautiful data shared goal today .
yes , even 'n <unk> , this is one another .
and it 's about something cool , whenever i 'd like , take ' that we all so this ai n't kind <unk> could do , so 'n let that every time .
right , so , that what the wind power means .
the text that holds the title <unk> and go way .
yes .
really fun with you .
the <unk> text is just one sentence .
i write ' so happy little <unk> .
this is a <unk> sexual pun .
sexually about <unk> s written .
it separately , s ?
yes , yes .
really fun with you .
yes , even 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> written .
is a very long sequence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in verbally to explain this is the point .
here , even a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he already know , before i do this a look like this warning .
he had me and purpose of a little intrigued , then he would say <unk> .
i can i 'm later still in him <unk> .
i would tell him the joy .

with a featuring <unk> in the face where else ?
and purpose , it 's no longer trying to value , now by <unk> .
and i was later , but again , wake up to make it to do n't make a crappy day can have .
gives hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little kid .
what i said , and albert einstein , when he would be a steak medium does n't taste ?
i is a q .
so .
the letter q and sounds like the cow .
it 's why this funny .
yes , the text that 's also the paper to memorize them .
it 's closer , what political .
so , i write . '' this is not just fun things .
i write ' even know , and very political things .
and it 's jim , ' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , yes , there was ' i saw these text message here 's written .
he carries the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , then in my mother and i made her .
yes .
would we have this <unk> .
thanks for the sound .
yes , this is where <unk> ' i 'd like a little do advertising .
i have no business card or how do , so i have this was always <unk> do .

you can not quite a second round .
and yes , i <unk> ' , i <unk> '' actually much more likable .
and , yes .
that would ' i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more apps .
this is a little the advertisement that i once wrote her up .
feet .
rich in vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
you have ever been very funny .
i want one of a joke about the <unk> your friend of writing , but the punch it was just a flat .
yes , is not types of my <unk> .
<unk> youtube <unk> to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> youtube <unk> to we launched the <unk> out of linking it .
yes .
thanks for listening .
you were terrific .
thank you , i mean , ladies and gentlemen .
let me away with a <unk> question is beginning .
why do you <unk> all operate ?
i think everybody , the tax man used to be wondering , whether it at least some potentially of society , what to give you can .
the answer is clearly .
we know now , that life expectancy has point at birth of just about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
this means it has sort of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we know it still much less ?
why are we were bombarded by <unk> messages from <unk> who in part one another -- disagree with ?
so if you look at all 15 years ago it seemed to the guilty found .
it was fat .
you 've figured out , if you fat from the food , old-fashioned style , we all become <unk> and be healthy the old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves at various <unk> in america in supermarkets , made me and what 's nothing to change it does that the americans every year 's thicker have gotten .
then you have said , oh no .
but not the fat .
there are some carbs .
then what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so on made me .
so it 's kept this ai n't new <unk> hurdle , through one village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste in part least on us through <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated indians from the science and wisdom <unk> .
case for a <unk> nor is here .
the <unk> you know about all .
<unk> published a lot more widely read a magazine , a new rubric .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for this is next year .
keith richards , i was seven years of top placed .
then passed the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest boy , the evidence , depending on earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there somewhere , people to say , they 're six hundred , you can , but your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> today .
and they listened to <unk> up to smoke and i began , but with <unk> back to then finally , with <unk> <unk> the path of the great to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is they will die .
what this tell you ?
not that , cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us that , aging , very complicated is , and that we -- the statistics , we do we need to give the experimental systems and we have a simple questions .
ai n't quite simple question , and a very simple issue , the in different countries , preserved mantis shrimp is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
that 's on testosterone up <unk> so , what in the male <unk> produced by step .
and there <unk> very clear evidence for <unk> men are just as old women .
you can now everybody for yourself think if that a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it 's get better yet , tips , not afraid .
in general should we watch correlation with this causality , to confuse morality .
sounds complicated , but it 's just at the common <unk> to illustrate .
there goes to so if you ai <unk> grandma , and asks what they have , because so different way or not eaten them to be so old age are ?
ah .
the granny 's born every 10 or smoking cigarettes .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?
that have the tens of cigarettes , maybe just not getting votes .
or , but they were getting votes , and the granny 's going to the tens of cigarettes , even older .
we ourselves hard stats is not more potent .
instance , there ai n't very hard stats that shows that people who <unk> in the <unk> go to get older than people who do n't do this .
and justly .
it would reproduceably .
this is at the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that just people enough money in the pocket have to be good to her age , and the <unk> diseases have to worry .
if i but a group of cause a <unk> to feed to admit , and this group with 20 percent longer exists as an ai to a group of the <unk> right got , but otherwise very same thought was then i was actually probably a <unk> factor in the food being affected .
and actually are these attempts been done .
have to tell , the <unk> is very bitterly what i did n't even i do with my enemies , agree -- this is that regular fast at the life longevity .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example with bacteria .
they 're looking at ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line showing up life are significantly more .
and the same for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was just about two years in america has shown that it even for the monkey recognized .
that it 's not trying to be thin to be .
it 's too much like to <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's another experiment , which in the united states has taken .
what did you did here ?
they give you ai <unk> taken and has been such a so-called <unk> administered to a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night he got .
and services , and wonder about it , the mice are called dick became , sick and have this ai n't really bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .

they did a day no food plan for which are their night at twice as much food .
and this <unk> now is <unk> and healthy and she was any <unk> .
when i 'd both animals <unk> feeding were .
both have a lot to eat .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens to be ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> turned it .
whenever they were organisms , or stem cells replicating food taken away then starting from the organism on , redundant ingredients in the cell or these degraded compounds coming off to turn into the energy to do .
that makes sense .
and that looks like .
you can see , in the cell as a challenge yourself <unk> are mainly due to crashed , the during the age <unk> .
the merged , then with your stomach of the ingredients are <unk> and the cell as energy back to spend your bliss .
they saw in the damages on the age , accumulate into limits what happened .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell this .
so , about it ' data , regular fast at expanding the lives in the different organisms .
and it 's likely to assume that 's also , in people work .
and we learn that it right now in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> day with 20 <unk> fight are .
no .
but , they 're supposed to say , if you 're hungry people , ah , maybe is under the <unk> turned it .
welcome change your hunger , as a boyfriend .
and that makes it also <unk> sense .
while <unk> decimal point , nine , nine percent of human history has the person , what we 've done , when he famine had ?
right , he 's stuff has gone .
we go missing in the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry people .
and that 's safe for the biology .
now we know of course , and this is already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is readily , but the meat is weak .
the garden , looking for us pretty different .
here 's kind of ariana <unk> in a medieval paradise being shown .

and this is like the actual <unk> .
we were so on the lookout for substances in a way , the molecular response of <unk> <unk> despite the organism is eating .
and that could for people to be interesting to their <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might be in front of the hardest <unk> of life and preserved .
the question is so that we can <unk> , the <unk> , the extracellular <unk> <unk> , although you eat ?
and we have a hundred , at the thousands of immune scans , natural substances .
we have in fact that a found that means <unk> .

in your skin is it on <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells to be , for example , then you see here .
this is this ai for humanity cell , here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> full circle and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell made of the crashed , the during the age <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells might be precisely look like .
and it works in the different organisms .
here for example , shown on a <unk> .
so we ai n't matter what i found the molecular <unk> lightbulb the <unk> .
life , because the organisms that no longer .
and the answer is again , yes , you see this ai n't typically <unk> of a <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are all dead , after a guideline days is about half the dead .
whenever we <unk> the water , again , here in very colorful characters are the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know that human cells are by donors about an ex vivo <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we want to <unk> shoes .
and the latest research , we put too close that even the lives of all over mice , through <unk> longevity is going .
and it 's not only the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are significantly <unk> .
so .
there 's talk of all know , where <unk> ago ?
how the name is already says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , because it comes into very high levels of one .
but i can feel comfort , even on <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms that cheese , and a product of <unk> soybeans , what in japan , big <unk> enjoy , that 's the test <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we then i said , if <unk> against <unk> helps to make it the crashed <unk> does it then we might be able to <unk> ?
they have you know that the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the age <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have in fact that experiments that made about .
they 're wondering , we have about fruit .
that flies are going to be a forgetful memory , if you 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms to the memory in charge who are pretty much as humans .
now you may ask them anyway , like the hell does the fellow and the memory of flies have lived ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stefan seals , of college . berlin , you did .
you take a hundred fruit and close the ones here 's give them a smell , the they love .
<unk> .
and let the way in this <unk> <unk> .
then take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and we give <unk> different smell , the they love , because <unk> .
we let the <unk> enjoy , while you ai <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then take over the same fly to do these pure .
the driving this degree in the elevator , down , because you see the .
and if you down here we went to have to give them from one hand <unk> and of other side <unk> that .
where you go on the all around ?
yeah .
the cherry cola .
except two people here .
this is the <unk> .
or , we 're saying , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i want to be ' i 'm not by this ai <unk> payoffs to corrupt .
okay .
but it 's this ai n't form of the character , to the age increases .
not just to fly .
and we could actually the <unk> the flying through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , equivalent to bring .
and the <unk> , the in the brain came that were , and again , mined land .
i mean , <unk> does n't just an aging world , but for <unk> diseases , maybe .
and that 's important because we want to say the <unk> not the life time per se is prolong life .
it does n't make sense , the time the <unk> to extend .
and i want to do n't release , without you 'll make a few practical tips to give us , we maybe some younger .
now we 'll <unk> fast .
it 's not about that you weigh collapsed or something .
there are actually now in austria , ai n't set of <unk> people who a day of eating and a day n't eat .

and the last thing is very well .
i mean , it 's <unk> .
and avoid them <unk> .
it 's not about carbs , complex , carbs , it looks nothing too dangerous to be .
it 's really take candy .
you know now , that <unk> sufficient to have to diabetes , trigger , even then if you <unk> are .
and you know as well , that sugar the growth of tumors -- accelerate around .
here it ai <unk> , the front of moving towards the ages .
after 30 days are all dead .
very low doses of glucose reach out .
for a <unk> effect in making .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all of organisms that .
food they regularly fruit and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of too much <unk> or of <unk> ever .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can manage .
this is not in certain circumstances of vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter of <unk> , because vitamin d being driven by sunlight on the skin , educated .
some that you least three times per week , ai half hour , sports , this is completely trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the bet <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years of our lifetimes .
do you look at times of everlasting <unk> occasionally the rest of .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is really notice .
because the monks that lives almost as long , '' as women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> are still more than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
people assume that 's what with addition , immune to do .
way , way that 's very simple .
so whenever there 's a <unk> the window , it 's plaster ' i was up with <unk> <unk> work the way .
and what do anything else does it 's probably in her , vascular system .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , going to because alcohol in certain circumstances where <unk> .
why has no alcohol in this ai <unk> effect .
a long-term partner and did n't it ai family is about longevity is associated with .
they should not at a lot of the busiest streets were living .
now you think about <unk> .
this is , but with <unk> nothing to do .
it 's preserved .
you can measure the closer , somebody on a lot of the busiest streets lives , the more <unk> he 's the blood .
and it as well , if he says , i was always has gotten .
i can already fine to sleep and the sounds of mind .
not true .
he even more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
exposure to be limited to be because <unk> course .
we know now , that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
all about it may your cholesterol lower .
and we also know that white onions and <unk> bucks on this infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers have been around us with <unk> and so on <unk> have .
certainly not without purpose .
many studies show that dark chocolate is by dementia <unk> act as possible .
just recently is a beautiful part of high , who has shown that this ai n't visited by the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> one <unk> on this level of a <unk> can be .
similar suspected that you of coffee there 's the <unk> now thinner .
there are trials , the show , there are trials , who does n't show .
's clear , this is that coffee , diabetes <unk> work , and for their metabolic performance better .
and the coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> out , how we share with that guido <unk> from paris able to show .
ai n't very beautiful and intricate study in the hundred thousand people or 15 years of studies were having demonstrated that people that every day , ai handful of nuts to eat their <unk> about 20 percent down .
this is a huge value for the ai <unk> study .

but not to peanuts all the botanically seen in fact , beans .
the be just about , putting it was nuts , which now , okay ?
that are actually , and beans .
so for the peanuts , so is not .
the next thing is a little bit dodgy .
and avoid them from , the of a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old regimes .
ai n't very beautiful new research shows that you , if you in the horizon over animal protein to take your <unk> so much more medication , as if you an enormous smokers , be .
this is not for the time afterwards , where the animal protein , which are good and it 's obviously not for <unk> children or teenage years , the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and those individuals who do they want .
we find that they <unk> .
whatever they do , keep it 's silky , that i knew already , friedrich nietzsche that the answer is the objection to the <unk> to joyfully suspicion that <unk> are signs of the health .
all of unconditional orders have heard in the office .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> who has about after that regime , lived and he 's <unk> years old .
it comes from my home <unk> from <unk> , is never get sick .
and he gets very good .
he 's just not <unk> nor what 's not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's particularly a lot of healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed that i do you today was saying .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments , ai n't important fact , however , not passed .

you <unk> the old people have to and it could one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the great novel at the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers karamazov .
a piece , at the contemporary of critics in the adolescent , fresh <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i do you think it .
a question , where now , no one morning , they have , because that 's kind of avalokitesvara , namely , who of them is very lonely ?
the output 's very low .
without even when i thought .
it has but probably the reasons why you may not reported that have also the people that for itself is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse solitude and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
this is that all the case .
you 'll see , and loneliness is really a phenomenon , among humans than just to be .
maybe there is it also strongly believe that they 're not reported here , because the question of focus contract is .
you feel you are lonely , or is you very lonely ?
and you are lonely experience , without feeling lonely .
and you can be lonely be without looking at the moment lonely , to feel .
and loneliness is too much to shame , to do .
well that 's some now let me stop the set up and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness is a shame and the shame , comes from loneliness .
and loneliness that takes time .
well , so we will now here , no station , have a few seconds , where i would you gave up .
and loneliness to take <unk> .
and loneliness to take the time to get their own , even aware of being .
and loneliness and also need training exercise to talk to be .
and this exercise to have we put themselves not .
we have neither the language is still have we signal for ourselves to recognize when we are lonely ?
there are being more loneliness to two <unk> , where i kept going to spend my own .
the one part of man says , you is from beginning of lonely .
from birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go then we tend to <unk> and drive up all day off .
i ' no time , is so you <unk> .

that i have n't actually , so , i just a piece of big universe .
and there 's the large sample , to the this i am the time , so , in the great way .
the thinking , okay , today , i 'm very lonely and the next day , oh , it 's all together .
if we of loneliness to think falls that keeps us to start with the whole lot of loneliness is an overall .
the loneliness of dying of loneliness to the sick in an icu .
but about this <unk> , about these large <unk> <unk> ' i 'm not speak , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , where loneliness that we also in such a theater , meeting can .
i 'd also do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> of <unk> .
and loneliness that in other , maybe there kind of we usually did n't find a lot of loneliness to us to detect <unk> already .
the photographer and christine , tailors , has in the break a few photos taken that i want to show .
how easy it keeps us lands , at the other and loneliness to detect .
that we all know , not , whether these people are in this moment lonely , have felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment in such <unk> event , where you think , everybody talks about each other , just put itself is something lost in the corner and does anybody to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
maybe some you today has been seen .
what you to do you put the phone out very often , again , it could you today is very well , and seeing is that playing around , that <unk> on the mobile also an escape from the solitude .
clearly into view , if you on the display bit .
what we now here 's not .
yes , and then there are more loneliness that separation from them down the loneliness to a <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces have a huge and you have a little drop in the hope that you their text , not forget .
this is the <unk> that you the outside of seeing .
we are people to attach .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , the way of birth of lonely experience of their entire life that would redesign have to make you have tried , and loneliness to me about <unk> , will distract them .
and there in this room , guarantees the other people are lonely , are , because they 're going on a different people to give you have to be because of death or because of a distinction .
because it also do anything that have so many people , including humans , with whom they are connected , around them are they are lonely .
and there are people who have the relation to herself could find any contact with more to yourself and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit ' guys , juxtaposed against the analog teaching and loneliness .
the analog teaching and loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people who after their opinion when it shortage of social contact .
well that 's always had relative .
there 's not an official number , not bound volumes , when somebody being human contact -- he said , when i do n't .
we 're falling down immediately the older people a .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities like housing fused together with lots of people at facebook or using twitter or facebook is this digital and loneliness to becoming bigger .
you can have hundreds of people to be connected , without using a single person 's really connected to be .
it 's the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
now these forms of loneliness to be very much against <unk> .
this is also strongly believe that the analog teaching and loneliness to a mold screeching in .
whereas the digital and loneliness to be good place for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's of date , that the digital loneliness to the future more weight gain boils down unless the opportunity to be able to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know whether you in two decades , that feeling that the way of loneliness is very similar to be going to more loneliness to call it will .
or whether you for and then a new word for them .

almost go bigger than the loneliness to it 's the fear in front of loneliness and from this fear in front of loneliness that are people say to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the model tells you , what people do everything to not enough to be .
they build cathedrals , they account for children who then after another lonely experience more and alone .
but that <unk> , she did n't naming , around the fear in front of loneliness to kick which is to spend money .
and shop to go .
things him .
both the process over the kind of loneliness , because it very short term for us attaching it as well , the objects themselves that you picked up .

so we have kept going to new things to buy us new <unk> .
i ' time the advertising has for a <unk> panties label seen .

what this at the panties got to do , you know you do n't , but apparently you can also that .
and loneliness is so none of solitude and to do loneliness to find out of people like this right instead .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , but the worst is the loneliness to popular .
hand on it 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to be waking up the or the other while brushing your watch out and suddenly , terrible thing only to feel that feeling lonely , to feel and the question to ask , who is this guy really ?
it made ' i do with the difference to do ?
a survey that over the most lonely , women around their 40s , married , with kids , feel .
evidence that 's missing , because i now you could n't know , if i study to itself , i 've invented so often have sex pistols ' i they told .
but now is no matter because it at least in studies , mostly care is , and the reaction was always equal is that people before me <unk> .
that intuitive way to be completely obvious thing is , almost an <unk> .
and loneliness to popular is anyone familiar and yet , we speak not about them .
speak very much about the loneliness and they had sex .
well that 's probably everybody has been present .
even when you <unk> is getting started to think , what do ' i 'm really ?
who is this person in my bed , anyway ?
this is also a form of loneliness is n't exactly what to do you 've got to the quality of sexual <unk> .
but nothing to do you 've got to the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't look at .
we talk a place , not about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness and also <unk> than we think .
i was recently in such <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , should say , three contributed to suit and two people carrying costume either .
these two men have a conversation , the two women in a costume -- they 've entertained .
and the way of state something <unk> , something <unk> with <unk> in my hand of an intern .
i believe , i have to give the scene , not going to do with her this form of loneliness that everybody has been doing in time in his career has experienced the <unk> can .
it 's the most of loneliness of <unk> .
it 's also the loneliness of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , sitting there might be a couple of their lives <unk> at <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> into hotels , in a generic paper , bars of times as i could n't know who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
well that 's a form of loneliness to about the not talking about this is .
just heard it also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> misuse it can be .
cue on here is a typical skyscraper .
i did n't even a <unk> told that he called was inspired by clients , and he said , he said , it 's what really horrible happened , you can do n't you imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so he himself to <unk> this guy .
and two months later , he 's also people resigned .
the loneliness is not only reason why .
she 's not always with other feelings .
it 's beautiful siblings and she 's ugly , sibling .
the ugly siblings , we 've all .
fear , and sadness in desperation , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful boys never forget .
the freedom of the proud of aspiration that <unk> .
so my plea look at the loneliness .
and come down in life as the tide , and floods occur .
let them to and you can take any of her drive .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that may have to think of loneliness is that you have no longer feel .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i like a lot of loneliness thought i 've got to me two things change .
one in my suffers from the <unk> i could n't like one sided with a dictator since i realized inside that i only then over someone phoned me to put why he was n't touch , because i thought was probably grip , i the people , maybe to push ' i lonely .
it 's been able , since i of loneliness and in my life accepted some people come and go to leave .
's exactly how it with acquaintances , the you look like power .
well , i got to free .
people come and go to make , you could n't immediately to track , whether it turns out an encounter a friendship , even a partnership add things .
when he was kind of my parents an embarrassing .
the can look at any <unk> they walk away with a conversation with anybody .
if in the <unk> or in business .
every time i did it to limitless conversations .
as a kid , i found that as i 'm embarrassed .
as young adult , i know it 's incredible amount of <unk> that to get this openness to have .
but first since i have a big on and loneliness to keep up to do you get me anyway , and go back to me also direct acquaintances , like to open .
you see it 's very lonely , his name themselves ready to do for the nearest set .
thank you .
yes , thanks .
i ' point three out pigs that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and i 'm curious sex pistols ' i do what if it suddenly engage appear to walk out appearances , they would take ?
most boats would be considered for <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the lowest energy the biggest impact on outcomes .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
so let the effect on the great effect disappears completely other than eight and we can make us , for some strategies .
we can make us for example of <unk> and the stands for sports .
big <unk> but in a huge effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we can make us to the <unk> .
the stands for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me why did not so valuable .
and i want to tell you do with the lowest energy the biggest <unk> term .
if you look at prevention and health may be preoccupied , where you make an issue of ai n't unique .
and the issue is overweight .
and this topic either overweight , was in germany , long time , no matter , kind of up in the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany would be a lot of .
and i asked me , which was there on in the <unk> ?
why did n't that soar goes up ?
and then i did research and i 'm also a wall .
because it was just by <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> to germany .
and we get over and burlier ?
and i kept watching .
<unk> comes running , to germany .
and that obesity , go up .
and in <unk> take the curve , again , right speed up .
and what happens then to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it means .
and we get over and burlier ?
well , then i was one , and one was cleared out .
because it did n't you know .
exercise power in diameter .
and of stuck ' i 'm not here to them to say , sports , thick .
because this is not .
but one thing we 've now have noticed .
the tide of any new and training -- and <unk> did n't it led us to thinner and you’re going .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and then there ai n't really wonderful study from the states .
well , who have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> system .
and then they wanted to shortly after watching , so what happens to be ?
and they 've seen , people would actually becoming less fat on , but people taking whatever they were fewer calories to be but nevertheless , and burlier .
and this was a paradox .
and would have you <unk> called .
we can be able to explain that ?
there must be the body as a plant , imagine .
here 's like this ai n't really <unk> .
and on the one side of it 's a <unk> , because i do we all the coals on that might be here is incinerated .

if we now , but more the coals on fire to be in our power station , when we 're going on the other use <unk> at the energy in the power station and it makes you slam them .
the human body does n't matter , 'pow .
the way in the energy stored .
and it changes in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we 're like we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> here is the energy , then makes it 's just one thing to .
the <unk> has dramatically reduce .
here is no life , more than it .
we 're yes , just a mobile .
and this is what happens .
our grandparents are <unk> last 20 kilometers to walk you walk .
and we come today degree at one to two miles and are the positive estimates .
there are trials , the reports of five -- until <unk> meters .
i <unk> ' you the other thing . <unk> with my friend mike tell .
you giving me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you come degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's really shy , he will not much about transformation .
and he was back at this trial here , and sitting now here .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> have designer jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in my hand .
and mike , eating more and more and it 's <unk> , and yet it gets over and burlier .
why ?
because that mike 's seat .
and i 've ever watched , how much exercise that mike 's a day , and tell him times as a step counter the back in the pocket of maths and at night i 've got back to <unk> .
and there was put a thousand steps .
it was the distance that mike , from here 's the morning , the kitchen table to the car with the car back office there , obviously a little bit of coffee go get the evening again .
and he came up a thousand steps .
that means that mike came on that day for 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes i was mike , or was mike .
in these conditions that creates disease by itself .
and mike 's not why did dick , because he too much eating , because as long it up again and energy <unk> that does n't use it 's necessarily always a thicker , and the energy <unk> up .
and the first <unk> at the energy , as you can see on his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that they ca n't there .
the <unk> will come back in <unk> blood .
and also because she 's an active and <unk> still , and quiet on his <unk> .
so the sugar .
so when the energy <unk> the blood , then we 're talking about the physicians of high blood sugar and high <unk> .
and these sugar , the <unk> out how <unk> , makes us around little hole in this <unk> .
and a happiness goes there 's that all the ones around , and the edges are going to talk about those wounds and we are talking about <unk> or atherosclerosis .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood around these tight <unk> jars , pumps and we are talking about blood pressure .
and if the blood pressure goes on such a <unk> true , then makes it on their bodies -- slam them .
and if that the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in your happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second of heart attack , stroke .
i mean , in germany and dies every second thing <unk> .
and also mike gets so not so sick , because he did n't make a sports and drinking water , but because he was nothing more moved .
and if you these interrelations n't know , then it looks for you always in the wrong spot .
for example , when you could talk about diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday we 'll be a robot at the amazon line -- and there are coming in schools , <unk> <unk> <unk> , until now .
and if each book , just like an inch is thick and we would have here <unk> , would we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i have the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now this is really important if you more energy , or so much food as they consume and then they get fat .
and if you less energy , or when they consume they will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to schools , books ?
that makes one thing to .
this desire is obviously , huge , but <unk> is that no assistance .
because why have failure of diet , to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what we 're using the things that we 'll give three weeks to do and here 's five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , back into the normal life comes back , to our ordinary life .
we are left , then i usually after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .

so you allowed to go of today is present new robot which is present new <unk> ask you can , and you want that in their day-to-day , in their life around community .
yes or no ?
and if you know , and then <unk> .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if the end of nowhere to be able to it 's strictly a waste .
it 's the habits are about to decide whether we get sick or stay healthy .
it 's the bad habits , the us to get sick .
and it 's the good behavior of us healthy .
and mike , in the mirror , look , i 'll see it 's where the result of their daily lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror , you look , then you see it 's where their daily habits .
and mike , in the mirror , look , and now actually happening is , then you see it also , where he is driving .
because if he 's more bad habits , as good news has then it 's the same place to come from transit .
and mike , in the way to moving towards wellness -- kind of its goals , along its dreams , then it needs to do n't pick up his whole life change .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a , and talking habits and mike 's also a great examples that the human being an odd animal is .
mike 's for example , managed to move out completely his life <unk> putting it every way to the driving an escalator , using , everyone to lift 's .
and night is he <unk> on the couches and have a way , tying to explore motion .
so he using up in his <unk> goes into the gym where to get an escalator , up what you know , per se quite ironic is , and then becomes like this ai rat , again on such a band <unk> , so he got back to shift coming .
and my grandpa , would be the way it 's amusing , as you .
the was a farmer and the really does n't understand .
the said , sport 's kind of people who 's not move .
and somehow he 's right .
why we need at night in our resopnsible for their leisure time that to compensate for what we in the real forgot to have ?
protect them , we need to look at this <unk> lifestyles after two hours of sports can make a day .
so much about something very much easier to the move back up to find where they 've lost .
on a day .
and so <unk> ' i do today to a perspective to invite you .
may also refer you the situation , you drive the evening again , you quickly for shop , and picking up , that in the front row no place , free is .
and you see how has been programmed , this <unk> in us is .
we always wants to the shortest due to go .
we plan our homes and so that we are <unk> have a way .
we plan our whole life that we are <unk> have a way , but that brings us are n't get out there , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so you allowed to some of today , the <unk> activate and the move back out where it 's degree , they 've seen .

and i 'm the only , the way up and down and up and down there 's now , and everybody else away .
but if i mean , ever since i 'm then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement of that 's just picking up .
and if from above the announcement up , 30 minutes repository , 'that ' i hooray .
schools , steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes . it means .
and a , and talking schools , steps , if you go of today , every night schools , steps more to go , that means that you end of the day , 12 gram of fat , not in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , as a habit established , even <unk> days , and then we talk about four point five pounds of fat .
that we 're not in our bodies have .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> '' it always <unk> .
the americans are the crazy , the question , so what works .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
who believe that one of me four pounds .
so that you 'll see , what happened there with those baby steps .
and if that the effect is about this perspective , what you mean , what we 've just happens when they really in an active life to start .
and this <unk> the bring them off now , every day in their day-to-day .
once you with <unk> steps per day come to have to do you virtually every <unk> them .
and if you 'll feel and i have time in sports and then do it on top .
then you have to the <unk> also <unk> .
they will also even faster and stronger .
but do with your health may not depend on the sports .
do with your health may not depend on your notion and of their time .
because the most important thing that they do now , every day when western lifestyles .
and i <unk> of an active life <unk> .
and for me , it 's gotten more than a lifestyle , for me is it 's lives that on a clear that decision based on the lives and for myself .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do n't do that the right .
but health has to do with , what we do .
and so <unk> ' i now only one idea for them .
you decide up here today , just go for the best thing .
and by now you can also how it goes .
step after .
thank you .
<unk> how does it 's a leonardo is something like da vinci , actually managed to such unbelievable , <unk> kind and it 's how the world with other way to see ?
and then reshape themselves as far on that engage in which at his time just simply inconceivable , unimaginable happened ?
we could have that again today ?
this has been able to do with companies to do ?
and how we can turn into force and confidence , for our future to draw ?
we go , but let 's look at the question what we understand that actually melt down innovation ?
yeah .
technology , innovation fund research and development in fact that the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know i 'm really .
well that 's all great .
and we can use quite proud of this is , and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of the fields are that our technologies around the world is needed to be that it 's good order to go .
that we do with a bit extraordinary , unique , wealth 've developed .
but what about it with the future from ?
the challenges to come because when society around us to ?
and who cares about , because there to the major environmental and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> '' it seems like that mattered to be .
a kind of division .
so the economy that looks at the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort with the we get productivity and efficiency , growing .
and the world better , i want to find yourself in the nonprofit entities , and bring together and citizens and they have to then also what do so basically all the nonprofit course , by then the damage the term capitalist 's economy to deal .
at least <unk> to fix it .
but who says , because that we do things as separate between need ?
how would because if we <unk> by ai social and cultural dimension to keep them ?
if a technological innovation also cultural innovation are ?
if the economic innovation also an incredible innovations that are ?
if we were capable leaders , thinking and doing is heading back together with the solution in a huge ecological and social engineering challenges ?
if we also very different character , unknown to rediscover <unk> and if we were capable a very different , and fair <unk> movement forward ?
because what was that ?
both sides were but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask yourself , maybe a duty .
so far we have the same as a contradiction be considered .
fortunately , it 's heartening examples .
muhammad yunus , has with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh , incredible debt of you caused by the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more nerve in direct <unk> in the way , what the government <unk> done have .
and he <unk> as entrepreneurs , i must have noted for the prize <unk> get .
in the opportunity because when i think a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
worse , i must imagine <unk> <unk> .

and super trained , has also from their supply should be saved .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the game players .
and if you to see , then you think , well , where our offspring , because we need to take our future , i did n't care .
yes , right after college , he 'd go somewhere here 's begun to work at one of our <unk> <unk> champions .
that makes it also very good .
like that he went and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something that this is there 's so in him .
so he says to be there 's not even more , the way in my box ?
so that this entrepreneurial , he says then the time .
companies are the above all over <unk> .
and that liked him too .
and he enjoy those same <unk> .
so the right there 's also <unk> , the he actually get detected .
so not that he put in person knows , but so the <unk> tell him the right now .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three n , the story does n't .
so even more , it was surprised when the back then when <unk> personally was introduced .
as mr. <unk> .
and as 'n experienced in business , he teamed up and then there are introduced .
that 's great pleasure of pain , so with young people together , there , his own experience of science .
and the two 've got ta put together , i found .
and they 've ever more than once made .
how would because if we just like in a lot of these conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes ! mister <unk> , so what was that because again , right .
what 's exactly the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> subset of business ?
i did n't quite understand .
yes , so , <unk> then we 're starting to be able to look at the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , yes .
conventional markets , conventional products , conventional customers , conventional structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also very much prediction that to be looking at the large figures <unk> .
and give you ai ai <unk> , though the very neat name is it can also off .
what 's because then we actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> been so one is it would n't guarantee it 's just not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something else .
it 's the news is a radically different character .
because it does it means nothing <unk> .
not a subset of customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of why is a <unk> a temporary organization of the instrumental in a model to look , to find , to develop the recovery is , natural that , but in would reproduceably put it up and then we scale it .
and you 'll be safe to understand that 's obviously in such <unk> organization was a different different ways that there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yeah , it 's what i 've been clear .
but after what are we should really ?
so , i jump , ' time to e : okay , they terminate where the drum at least amount <unk> <unk> money to make right ?
so i ' there 's also degrees , this fits quite well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin , would you would recommend it ?
this means <unk> .
how you know your business success <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> did .
oh no .
but really <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , 30 your <unk> money did what 's because after your <unk> ?
so <unk> you a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what if you with your commitment , like you know ?
and as well let me a time the <unk> on .
so the statistics about <unk> give any <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are few years since then in a lot worse , financial situation better than before their major free .
it 's always the result of a successful company and one thing the community-led enterprise .
now , you money is a source to engage actions .
and it , the basis of economic trade .
but it 's never the goal a company .
yes , which is then the goal ?
from a company ?
so when i 'm going to pick ' i ' yet we learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , frankly , you 'd still is what 's measurable in time may be and so forth .
and when i do it 's not have sex pistols ' , so this as i can get all kinds of the i do n't know what i look to do ?
so that makes me do n't feel good .
so how do i , since the decisions , and risk everything that feel for me all this very vague , uncertain .
yes , <unk> welcome to the enterprise .
but i '' because maybe what it for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so much like a little secret .
and study <unk> by generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how to tell you today ?
<unk> believe that ' i , <unk> ?
so we say , keep getting <unk> that .
in acute crises and <unk> and <unk> placing of uncertainty .
so help save them .
i believe that ' , i can tell you from me .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are the only ask me .
that can tell you the same time i remember one of the big engage qualities that 's good question to ask .
we can the time one after the other things go out , i who might be better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want to here and gals ?
yes , <unk> , because it gets <unk> what drives you know that about you it goes beyond that 's bigger than you are ?
what <unk> you in the world ?
what people a lot of them , if you with you work ?
what you 're willing to be ?
what are your inner , may well unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we have this of learning ?
if you a ship and we tell you want to go <unk> not the men together bits of work a name it on wood to collect , but i teach them , obsessive desire to flare which is limitless , the ocean .
yes , well .
so then a distance , i let me the next questions about .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , <unk> now allowed you know your goal really ever conceived .
colorful color in detail , colorful , but i <unk> ' you 're going to a if you <unk> , what you do n't want to then it will take you hang onto this .
know you actually the story with pink and elephants ?
when i think there is a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , hey , to give up .
reset your time , not a pink and elephants .
okay ?
works , it 's that ?
so , not a pink and elephants .
understand ?
not a pink and elephants .
you see ?
so it gets us , if we so happy to focus on this , what we do n't want .
so what actually the only way ?
because focusing on <unk> ?
yes , right , 'cause ' you 're going on , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas on the <unk> .
but it 'cause you about .
the way , what i just gets you feel that <unk> right ?
i ' you 've got a brought .
a distance time , if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in into <unk> <unk> lord smith .
who that ?

i <unk> <unk> of youtube to <unk> me your <unk> t <unk> the time sill sill <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass into the master <unk> .
i is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i is what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady , smith .
oh , but really marry <unk> shoot youtube , already know ?
madam , as questions , <unk> <unk> <unk> youtube , one <unk> not , projecting <unk> <unk> may is out .
<unk> from <unk> .
linking it 's dad to the a matter of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> youtube ?
and <unk> what it out ?
is you know what we noticed ?
has something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower .
okay .
so , then let me a time , then , let 's where the bear rainforest is .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in into <unk> <unk> lord smith .
who that ?

i <unk> <unk> of youtube to <unk> me your <unk> t <unk> the time sill sill <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass into the master <unk> .
i is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i is what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady , smith .
and <unk> , how about telling you ?
so , i remember , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw her up .
i thought it can we did n't think that was .
and even more shocking , i was like me through your head of the rest is it might be that i actually , so around the course ?
through my life .
and , i gotcha ! it does n't mean totally new sense .
make up there are the immediate <unk> to prevent us that most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> need .
but what matters because now actually start ?
what jump , ' i was and what <unk> ' i 'm from ?
and therefore <unk> , realizing you your perception and difficulties , somewhere <unk> to be able to is this ai n't other major entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thanks , then we get any time to the next question .
how could i really have to my goal is a way ?
so , i find that this ai n't good question .
this curious sex pistols ' i 'm going every time as well , and i know that somehow not moving forward .
yes , <unk> , there is it ai n't good news for you .
that you get lighter and fall when you that might have been known as you have .
because if you your why is clear , your inner drive , and if you 'n concrete goal was an image looks did i promise you , it will go inside happen by themselves .
almost as a machine .
you 'll do n't really differently might as being a brainstorming , in your screen that things on approaching you .
that are then these famous <unk> that you wake up in the shower and you did .
and there ai n't question i recommend you look at the most important to show you know about , who you engage you could who you know about it 's advice on what they could talk about there more of input , more dramatic look at home to get .
and you 've also a huge role .
the medici family have this is terrific , and brings .
cosimo di medici family , if the left it continues to know , has been in his palazzo invited back in florence .
to lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , merchants and engineers , architects and he has this ai n't very intense <unk> fostered .
but not in our modern mind , where it ai went , yes , who is actually composed by ?
who 's right ?
but rather on that goes out of these different <unk> things that arose are so on any kind and it just one of them alone could have to come together .
well , yes , the next question is what good concrete next step i do ?
<unk> there are just think about the successful entrepreneur in the reason is very simple .
instead of the size of making plans and management and so on bringing them are always just in the next step .
because what would you because in terms of uncertainty and also do ?
but the run this really determined and with all the consequence out .
and if there 's and then nothing was well , dan rounds look like they terminate <unk> different step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's taken this ai n't other .
it 's why it 's so important that your purpose is clear .
it 'll give the national security .
and in the rest of how we 've actually all have learned ?
although we do it did n't know , and it also , nobody told you have ?
they 're known to tell you could n't even without sleep at the children .
so , this playful exploration is something that this image search and this <unk> playful image search , it 's also , the fun doing that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also just sort , an antidote to the uncertainty , the us will always so anxious .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so this sounds , `` it’s pretty awesome .
but i do n't know so , with me in the company , i believe that ' there must be more of executives to change that there 's anything happens .
and after the reasons , here in germany , there 's always like this general mood .
and i believe that ' , because they needed to the politicians first of making sure that are changing .
okay my boy , come on with .
how do here 's down to the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look here , down .
and you see ?
right , the .
this is the you change can , the you really change can .
or make it by mahatma gandhi to say , searching for the change that you in the world , looking at your own .
you feel safe , beautiful words and huge role models , but how do this is convenient to work ?
here to happiness is still 'n . with <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all sorts <unk> of crises , or if you 're too small , you feel for something or if you a <unk> feel and you 've all with you to do .
and if you 're in these situations they should ask what quote , you now , despite all of this curious sex pistols ' watch out of posture of you take you can physically help yourself powerful to feel .
just curious sex pistols ' `` get any time , what you look , sexually like , over the you just <unk> .
and all the end , just curious sex pistols ' `` what you actually sort of this recession or the , what 's bad happened is because i did .
so i do , if you answer is up what 's still worth it has .
yeah well .
mr. <unk> thank you .
and you think about that would be beneficial in my engage the way ?
yes , right .
and realizing you all about two things .
first time the eighth wonder at the clarity of your inner <unk> that go to your engage in aid becomes .
because it determines your perception .
and for the second eighth wonder at your inner where you even met .
because it <unk> you like the other people are you feel about behavior .
the future will always just then when we our own perception .
<unk> you 're making it ?
yes , i think of people .
thanks ! mister <unk> na go .
well <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you think about our <unk> ?
nice .
indeed , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now actually looking at this <unk> ?
it is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
clearly .
what i in the spirit can change .
<unk> means you can breathe tapped .
and this is , what the <unk> really like .

and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
now this is the <unk> .

by robert , bosch , about <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin -- or <unk> or how they all these hot .
let 's just that spirit to revivify it .
and anybody might be yes , from our <unk> the next of leonardo of our time .
you see the right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so obvious that i 'm with kids and their future study after all these are the kids in our future .
instead is that the view that i found most of time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i think this program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , i 've started .
we <unk> <unk> entrepreneurial -- which means you can look after the prison , either you add to do n't find in your left is easier to a little positions in the you 'll also can hold .
why charge , i 'm doing in misinformation about <unk> , so those already had failed at the big mistake i did ?
our program is far does n't easy to understand how the applets are they care for children .
and frankly , i would have thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is where i work would .
what you think is the critical lack of a factor in the child with the people who we work ?
we found out , it 's good models given that male of front-page good models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> are often it 's because it 's remember that the father , no sensible work has that he drinks , that he made drugs , consumes one or it to find ourselves in prison is .
and then a seven-year-old child think about what it from his life make you 'd like he may not even better idea , as a different lives might look because he 's no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> of them , martin , imagine .
martin 's statuses our program .
his father was an alcoholic and made the entire family life of the hell .
when he was 12 years ago , is his mother died , and he and his baby brother he had to go home .
there , it was the <unk> the great .
he was shy , and <unk> and so the perfect person .
to the day as being a little baby brother and to a soccer game so roughly <unk> has been in that the bottom are stuck .
there , transformers , by martin first ones <unk> through , he went on the other person on and proposed to .
and by this day he was respect .
and it went off .
violence was part of the end up to his life like in his father .
what 's going to reduce that i just described , got to continue ?
after the child and after the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you know , not much more than your illegal activities , and their <unk> spaces .
and they will someday , with people in jail is closed to allow us that it goes , their thoughts about the same thing around the was any better models are .
about what , you think we think about these people in common point , if you all together in prison , right ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better criminals are in <unk> .
they sell to assemble these drugs on a macro level and build even in prison where they 're looking at the prison <unk> could .
and that adds up in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
i mean , in germany will all convicted second criminals prison .
then there 's also people in prison , the really change the end .
but also have these people wear a label on his forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first building identity .
if you take positions in search , if you an apartment for me if you see new public relations to build on health care anywhere you will take this identity , with this project face , the you an approach in the company goes infinitely hard power .
this is the problem , before we are .
how we try to this problem to solve ?
the fact , you think about bringing lots <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
there are more entrepreneurial skills .
if you have a <unk> who created is definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only when this topic at risk management , he 's a little <unk> , usually play '' he 's not in prison landed .
these characteristics we hope for something positive power .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three blocks .
we try to the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
every note to write their own business plan and anybody takes on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then the problems , we were also for the custody at the <unk> , at the <unk> at the strengthening of your personal relations and also in a possible <unk> .
what kind of the founding go out of our program you happen ?
it 's a wide range , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> of <unk> .
a very much bandwidth and that <unk> ' i like to show khalid imagine .
<unk> leaders , talent and an illusion of fast enough money to do it already very early to trade with the cocaine seduces us .
he always had fun part , businesses to run .
he 's then <unk> first arrested way .
and this prison , he did n't very impressed me .
quite the opposite .
he says , which i do today , he went back in its second custody for the future .
<unk> is he got to the second time sentenced to go way .
and he was then only one of therapy of , and then the <unk> .
and there was learning it as he be entrepreneurial , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september ages of been released , has then october <unk> his agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's neat , he can point of life .
it was very good checks worked .
he 's now here with me .
who would like to figure out to speak up at him .
now we 'll go back to martin , from , i had to start telling them .
martin 's got to his childhood a training to cook flying and ended up in his hands in the <unk> <unk> .
and because alcohol , and drugs , there on the agenda are used to be a cycle of very quickly .
he was working along as d.j . and as guard .
twenty years , he ran this lifetime .
and he says , today , it to go back with this is lived to do n't realize self-confidence <unk> .
one day and hurting , he 'd want to about a <unk> so hard that he then he convicted by them .
he took on <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned as he become more force to more success and too much better life could come up with his <unk> to turn them or without drugs to eat .
and he was about his information so excited that he 'd found that would like he likes to pass .
and he was part of <unk> .
that 's really work .
he works well since the average two years with us and <unk> our participants across her path towards a freedom , because he knows about ourselves that , if you feel really do something like , and if you the right tools on the hand , get that much more is possible , when you 're oftentimes i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people like you .
people who inspire us in jail come up to external costs very kindly with us to come to people want to your <unk> , with your personal plans to help consult .
these are our authority , the <unk> talks in our lessons stop , this is students who <unk> do , <unk> the plans to make .
and that 's our mentors who did people immediately after the prison problems .
and also have these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our shows an exercise , who <unk> calls .
we glue off in the middle of space a lot of tape did people standing on a and our environment where you stand on the other side .
and i imagine then of questions .
and every time , when someone in space that question with the answer is called it on the line .
and there it turns out , what we all together have , if we 're inside of prison are , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and a few examples where the differences within which is following question .
i 'm going to a call social focal point up , or i had a member , what 's ever in prison was .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line and very few of our environment .
a question that i love to join me , the us all connecting , the <unk> ' i love you see .
that i urge you that they all of all of bed .
if we can take a little light given in the audience .
i can see them .
there are all .
terrific .
thank you .
i stand of them now a question , and if you that question with the answer , plunk yourself back down , otherwise would remain just they are .
this is like our our line that we 're moving .
i have in my life of illegal things done , for the i would be punished , can be turned it is not .
if you that question with the answer , plunk yourself , please .
that counts , drunk car safety threats to be .
that counts , maybe too low volumes marijuana or obsessed to have .
that counts , it with the seat , not entirely in fact , to have .
okay .
and it 's important also , maybe a single staff was n't always completely accurate and signed up to have .
all right .
most school lunch .
we have a couple of the angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they must be all over again , sit down .
in this question , if we are on the events to ask me to get our environment very often the mulling stage .
and many will also clear , as good luck , you might have had .
happiness with your parents , happiness with the environment , where they were growing up with my friends , but fortunately it , that you may not always kind of being caught you have been if you something on the edge of <unk> or even beyond this did .
what 's the result of our work ?
sixties percent of our students coming from within <unk> days after their released a work .
this is rapidly moving fast .
nineteen of effort has already autonomously .
a third of the donors are in the last year , were <unk> .
and our <unk> is about seven percent .
i had this is already told the <unk> of seven percent of that 's a <unk> in germany of <unk> percent of us accountable .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> year in the base thirty dollars .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , what a <unk> of seven percent for a <unk> of typically <unk> percent to save means .
when my father and i was dating this <unk> started to have , we 're open to give some pretty much for quite have thought was .
i remember my great <unk> in a big corporation for dead .
but i have to tell , and i picked up in my life does n't like a <unk> work done .
we encourage people want to taking responsibility .
responsibility , what in your life 's happened , and all about responsibility for taking , what in their lives will happen .
are not to hide , nothing to whitewash .
because that leads to a whole new social confidence and allow it again toward this again , trust us to build .
and therefore it makes me very happy and pride and when people want to open , from their way to report .
this , i put them a little video to bring .
film that .
so i was convicted at two years , and eight months for a dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months convicted .
i have to the marijuana traded .
so , i have a judgment of received two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted for <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> has actually my whole life changed .
and what to me was vital that was this <unk> , the same , they do .
because there was my yes , my absolute deficit .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> ' i close to say , yes .
i keep goals happened outside busting him .
i whistled along the perspective of figured i 've got back to look forward , looking at .
and you go with a very different kind of consciousness and consciousness from the prison system .
so far it more <unk> without a strong financial goals and then is you know , and out into something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and that 's no longer .

that the biggest problem , because then is automatic and stereotyped and that once in the old <unk> coming .
you know you know anything else .
by this <unk> individual , coaching , no matter what 's where everything was offered is going up with me just all my thinking about myself , ourselves , about other , over the people interact with issues , over the people interact with the society , this is at me just as these two weeks after all of generations .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and since <unk> six months . bye '' i came along with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i 'm so among other through this whole <unk> and many other things that changed local control .
so much better '' i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
i work today in my quitting , <unk> ' i say .
i go ' one right <unk> to <unk> .
you have that actually acknowledge that 's very , many people are the fact , like for example of my mentors who 's also about this period left out and actually going to be yes , i do n't know , <unk> engagement , beyond the people to support .
i 'm thankful for them to be on the idea anybody ever come this is that they so what do .
i 'm thankful for that they do it could n't do with certainty the difficulty was pulled out and i 'm extremely grateful that i would be part of letting me .
these include , obviously also all the people to support , the process was .
i like i said , with many people at the events was speaking , and the me again and confirmed by this is good thing to go back .
and because jim , ' i do it also do .
and to tell him . '' so thanks .
they come up with us in jail .
each of you have something that we need to .
if they did people to your <unk> mentor , if you know when the <unk> to us to come to see if you in the frame of a financial support , on this is .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , very <unk> issue .
you 're talking about us in .
martin sebastian and i have here today .
and allowing us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i made up with <unk> <unk> for <unk> longer-term <unk> in nepal applied .
in a time in the i bit unhappy about the time .
because you make the things like .
look for <unk> promotion paths .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's true today really many opportunities for how to dissatisfaction able to interact .
specifically as you of dissatisfaction able to interact .
anyway , i was <unk> be discontent in .
with my work and so 'n bit about the <unk> .
what i 'm really of <unk> talk to .
and not of the real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i made me very precisely conceived as your life in 10 for decades , 30 years , look down .
it was a regular .
and this predictability was kind of scary .
it 's the least , expression .
basically i had an adult <unk> plotted here .
professionally , as private .
i did n't want me the <unk> road rage ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> back to throw this ?
and look , '' then what happens .
then what comes to me wait .
this was so , the idea .
i was that time , free <unk> at one day .
so as i <unk> .
the <unk> for me was even though <unk> the total was quitting .
you <unk> free the world 's living in some very little hotels and <unk> this country on a very <unk> kind of ways .
<unk> but occasionally be very <unk> countries .

this kind of these images and from cliché about living there 's really chronicles a way too .
and what it was for me after a while the key quantity .
i was that what i did too much .
to face .
moreover it was a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i do n't actually really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries were able to figure out .
to <unk> writing articles to be .
and around my vested interest to be breastfeeding .
how you 're learning has been better know ?
so you with the people who lives .
in the people living , with them home .
not in the hotel .
so i look at the challenges and with the problems of people really busy .
and so as you with the people who works .
anyway -- that was the answer that i 'm going to this question to be able to .
and that i wanted to do .
moreover , i wanted something meaningful life .
i wanted a contribution .
something to do good .
and this sense , up with me , especially with a <unk> even more strongly .
i did before you often in developing countries , but in nepal and i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil war is not just end , and orphans , but also lots of economic and social problems and left .
with an annual death per capita from <unk> euros of nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and then continue to one of decades , the poorest countries the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
nearly one fifth of the population suffer from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can not reading and writing .
all these facts is associated with lots of personal stories and experiences that i do on this journey has had hit me in a time in the i was willing and open was to change .
in the i have a difference , i wanted .
and drum up after my return of nepal , my decision , well .
i quit my job .
and applying to me at the aid .

because they just a defining time .
it 's about a serious application in <unk> international arbitrage to do .
and not make a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the jesus in some time in nepal 's lives will , and a funding has her visit to look .
hi ?
it 's got ?
my job application was really seriously self-monitor and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was literally flat-lined .
and it made of course , as a very emotional response to write .
and fortunately , never come up twitter’s trust .
instead said , ' if i used to be pretty strong feeling down to what good they hooked to do .
i did it 's used as an engine , around my own business , start .
<unk> .

a company that basically exactly that offers , what i then looking up .
because the way , a place on the way you traveling .
the way , a country right speed meet .
now by with the people were there 's life and can work .

<unk> you can actually in two words , break .
so karma , and <unk> .
this means much , like a place where you good so karma can gather together .
where you do good can .
so that now 'n little bit <unk> .
it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use a tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because people who inspire us go to afford their living meaningful volunteering that .
they pay for their journey , as with a different organizers .
but they travel very different .
you live in <unk> .
and the main goal is not least amount of recovery or as possible much <unk> but real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we broaden .
and i get engaged into our participants in time and qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work for one , stiff-limbed tourism change in the regions are promoting the otherwise , no chance to classical tourism that would .
because just the infrastructure to build that 's missing .
for others , we can sustain and projects will increase .
we can own sustainable design projects that initiate and funding .
we 're funded so to a hundred percent of self .
are also not on giving himself .

started to do so let the work <unk> in nepal .
convenes a year we have our engagement in uganda expanding .
and so after about four years turned out of us now i got married and my husband and i are also hired a team of <unk> question .
let 's the <unk> way to continue ?
or what if we get bigger than thinking ?
if we the <unk> still believe ?
if we have been not just a social engagement and sustainable to go back ; d in your wholeness is to embrace ?
and it also the individual <unk> to bring it ?
or specialty individual <unk> .
that would there 's basically a new one extra company .
a company , that look at companies are charged .
in other <unk> but the same culture like <unk> .
we want to this ?
i was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure that makes us that .
we are passionate entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 'd be ticking .
because we the same language .
because we the same as dreams were dreaming .
because we the challenges to understand .
and so we have this year <unk> one sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> we push creative companies in its development and start <unk> that we do with extraordinary people to support .
these problems , we the participants , entrepreneur , or some collaborators from the creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> evolution of <unk> contain .
and <unk> the on the <unk> prepare .
the there at <unk> again .
a mission to the next to a meaningful <unk> another advantage .
he shows a in relatively short on where you 're standing or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown to prejudice .
where you might be more flexible , is , to confined in thinking .
and he shows a way , what you really well , is .
and makes a his strength from western eyes .
whether it 's the creativity , the sudden , even great thing .
or whether it of serenity and they 're putting into being detected .
of serenity and things to assume that you wo n't change .
and the power , things to change that you can change .
and you can be much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
one example here .

that are five very beautiful women from uganda .
with a sad fortunes and with the craft .
they prefab one evening , was handcrafted <unk> years .
and the years was nothing .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they do n't know , as you the quality , we can improve .
because you nobody told by which is a design may be in the question arises .
we wanted those women help .
and have so this year 's also a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> product .
but make people out of poverty , get .
the you an income .
a future of reality .
we 're beautifully yesterday with our <unk> live on the system .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sales that gives them not only for a year , an income .
but allows us as well , this project has been much larger to do .
this first edition , is sort of social crowd , funding and <unk> in one .
so who do n't want , can this one with the purchase a chain , i want to the other it could , but with us either directly into the project to travel .
he 's able to the women are traveling together and it 's active <unk> .
long-term investments we do n't just five women a while giving , but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not only in uganda , but in nepal and in other <unk> , where we <unk> work .
this is , but this <unk> just a project from our new integrated the cycle on projects .
we 're working in all the core areas .
in terms <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in one field just too much is .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have this year in nepal and in uganda , including two <unk> centre , i 've started .
it reaches into our lives together .
and it makes more sense , as any one project for themselves .
collaborator , put our time and qualification into the various projects .
the specific ways to start to them all in the joint effort .
and in conclusion , i want more now on a journey to take them .
and that i urge you the eyes to close .
reset ' you before you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining room .
and you are satisfied and tired .
you 've just with your host family to lunch .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in there is it 's nice hot .
you <unk> from the window .
and see kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet tumble through the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
well on up to a thin coat <unk> dust .
children were laughing .
and calls for fun your name .
you <unk> you that they do you may not only <unk> .
<unk> .
you know , not , what time it 's .
but soon , you 'll get up .
and the <unk> , on the room for the children are running , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you going to lydia meet .
in the meadow , sitting in the shadows of the tree are you the new designs of their <unk> to talk .
and as you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come before the other women on .
they smile , you <unk> on .
until you with your english <unk> .
under the tree .
in the open .
after rumor that it 's still an internet gives us .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
it <unk> you .
the exchange is every time value .
it 's also you once in german , to speak .
you 're hearing about music .

mom fiona washing in the courtyard , the pots and down .
she sings of an african about the song .
you are lazy and happy .
you can perceive them back to do .
each of us can the <unk> to get together on something new engage .
now , or for a short time the dice me another way to throw away .
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm starting to take interest me , whether of you tonight , that they 're here , ever hear somebody 'n house work .
i committee , '' with the light does n't really well , but maybe i 'd like any sign .
down here the committee . ' i 'd want .
two .
this up the committee . ' i could n't , but at any rate down there are ever run two , that 's beautiful , we 're ever known to <unk> .
i did . '' this is also a building occupied and it 's the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with two decades , the other people have sex pistols ' i have a villa out in the last summer , six months ' work .
and so stuck ' i tonight is going on them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what is a 's also ?
<unk> it 's too many .
but i want it quickly explain .
oh , what you guys work now the villa along ?
and you <unk> in the park or how ?
one small sample of questions that we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you 've learned that i built into an initiative with what i whistle , '' to do something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all welcome to think we can blend seamlessly in the number of <unk> <unk> had .
and here around these villa <unk> set up , <unk> established , and bearing banners suspended these were .
and in order to the privatization of a villa out of object .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of protests .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here 's a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , the room and private is , and so for many people do n't available for it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but not in public hand , and why not that could be used , how to public spaces may use .

and we wanted another <unk> tell .
we 've been a <unk> team and that have i 'm very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and relations .
obviously also , at different social and cultural and personal backgrounds .
our perspectives <unk> and <unk> up .
and also allows us , at different skills , but also on various networks in convergent mode .
and creative in part unconventional solutions in the <unk> that we then ran out , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
but i walked away from us about that we are a villa with stories and try to occupy .
we have to memories and images being asked .
and of those memories and images of trying to do whatever the outlook for the villa out to develop .
those was it 's important that the process , more constructive ; it remains .
us as an initiative , even if we have of life as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a mental , and emotional sit and then go into a <unk> .
on the experiences , most of what we 've done , <unk> ' i tonight area .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face .
in many cases where this was , however , privatized law and commercialized and be in the result of citizens by strangers are places in another .
they 're dead places in a city because they saw in common , not the equivalent of what we 're in public space and expect .
so for example that we <unk> have to <unk> have .
are going , but also the fact , public , the urban places , neglected , is a lot , lying .
these initiatives , the places like that they brought want to stay in many other and scarcity of interest on their infancy , are .
what 's also with me to do n't like here some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our cities -- not just a face .
no .
they are the social and places in our own town , in our social life places .
so , form we have a lot of the first <unk> ride to our neighbors , if we get to make the way to the shopping together .
and make these details , if we saw an ai n't have tools , to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces are also designed accordingly .
and indeed we 'n longer ahead and have .
so , then form friendships , sometimes .
but what about security and it 's a sense of community .
more you face to me out in such a public spaces inside of the more quickly and the more likely to create a piece of those same community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , then arises in the same thing , what you think of anonymity basically a big city called .
we stood up with two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood woken up in <unk> also <unk> .
how is a protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can criticism in new ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , against the growing and actually did n't understand , <unk> just the same places .
think now , that they sit here , even before , they beat the newspaper on and reading over again .
i love <unk> and citizens , we invite you we want you three kinds of options for the redesigning the <unk> imagine that have a previously was carefully representative <unk> designed .
they ca later on in the idea of another version choose .
and the option , with the most <unk> is then , timely and implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone from them to this event going ?
perhaps not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds of first time a great .
there ai n't have a way , what , select .
they ca <unk> , like this in the future might look .
and as i said , like you once they loved by the first moment .
i trial '' i still in an explanation .
and now , because i the opinion , they ca n't really the first enlightenment , or pick out or shape , <unk> .
first , because traditional , <unk> often much too late <unk> .
that means mostly they have no opportunity , really , your suggestions to make or experiment on the alternative to argue , but there are already be ai , creation and they ca <unk> 're going to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , as a friend of other day said , what color the trash can have for example .
second one explanation about classical <unk> rarely go about information and vote out .
think about the three <unk> varieties .
we have is what that we want to show you and they must then you can vote .
the frustration and mutual incomprehension -- are often the following what i kind understandable need to find .
i certainly want to any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i really prefer the ai <unk> route , instead <unk> <unk> had .
it 's also different .
although we overcoming the existing <unk> lot of conversations that cost has been that we eventually demonstrated far greater comfort , to know .
so , then we 've experienced two day and the i want now , for some <unk> parts .
i want it can pass on others have initiatives , in other projects , but also , or in on the <unk> and at the politics .
because i saw in the ones who are , these <unk> really should be running and the most responsible for those things are .
because if this is really interested in a hill has , how it 's how often told me and he emphasizes that is then we need and then we need to retrain them new <unk> .
not least <unk> ' i 'm also all of you that you today , sit here .
and the reason , because i <unk> for very important to keep them .
i know , '' it for important that they all of course , and i want it with our case to encourage the <unk> another opportunity to give .
and i connect to me about them all , because they are those who are , the at the retrain them a new <unk> demand .
so we have credit to look around the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood and the notion of participation and <unk> to reignite ?
first about willingness to the dialogue going on the field .
in <unk> are professionals in layman to the citizens on <unk> and of self-interest to collide .
what we see here 's a picnic table , in the way we invited to have .
what we see here 's some of <unk> and <unk> conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all these conversations on the field work , so that 's not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills across the skills of the citizens are .
the citizens were there are experts , they 're experts on their neighborhood , you know what you missing , which <unk> a place to connect , in what tradition , a place that says , and also , what you were there 's missing .
the <unk> , especially with the city can bring in which on <unk> level in this project of traits to do .
in alone or in a particular case , can go further <unk> be involved in the themes of complimenting , the room on the project and mapped them , depending on .
it leads to a <unk> , where all these things for all available today is , and the then the ground up to be .
by maybe even trace food system will be able to an identification of the gps data allows us .
a dialogue going on the field ; also means that the wishes of a resident in fact taken seriously .
and it 's also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> near the marketplace .
this is capable of course , complete screwing up being , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all the same <unk> which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> then also the <unk> house , but maybe at a different place .
as i said , it 's got off dialogue , it will emerge .
second point is more nuanced <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one is totally you think he was <unk> large group that says , and speaking can .
another person 's good writing , but let the text , then not on <unk> large group .
another of course that perhaps better or ordinary light .
or puts his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i tell you want it has different <unk> give you look different user groups right to be .
we have here for example , the way , just to come to go to look at first time to watch , what happens .
in the background , ai n't have a small exhibition .
we have is the possibility of them anyway , <unk> to give .
we have the possibility of them anyway , to paint .
we have the possibility of them anyway , to write .
regardless of the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the way of our ideas with the faces to connect with ideas to <unk> .
well , the way outside of <unk> <unk> up to participate , should be given to be .
this can take over a <unk> happen , it can go over <unk> <unk> happen .
the timely and transparent that availability of the results can support the interaction among the them .
we even have the entire process in parallel postulate on facebook were traveling and on one of independent blog , while news , timely talk about a newsletter that .
our third thing <unk> .
you may recall , strongly that i said that <unk> often too late to take place .
in my <unk> event , we did already used it finished the planning .
<unk> 's the process , but then when he early intervention and the retrain them in the best , who was n't know what about <unk> area should happen .
if through the dialogue , and so i came back at one moment of being discussed this is something which are scenarios for an area in the question .
<unk> heard the way too , for <unk> itself .
and this was then , if not from the start rice mill is that the <unk> event like , and so look up , but on the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , when the citizens in your city , acquire and your city <unk> .
it 's already in a bunch of projects to see .
i have made of an example here from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is likely to a lot of this stuff .
in new york was just a project set , because it gets to a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> are there in six weeks <unk> dollars combined for coming up the funding of , you should do now , or <unk> .
the time has led in august i wrote the politics , i could n't even think differently , as the idea to their own making .
also the <unk> in new york , in the way i believe that ' i could n't need to say , because he has taken into the most important <unk> the city has become was no idea of politics or government .
the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> stood on solid .

the city was told <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we for <unk> <unk> have to the rich very different than <unk> out .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e , wonderful work and the city of the <unk> , the initiative , who 's set up and other <unk> aid .
and elsewhere , paint people in your own , crossing in the street .
in rotterdam , there was a <unk> footbridge erected before .
pretty well as far , you want to just say .
then we do , but now , just like .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to leave .
why ?
one , because they did a look for it all have or should have .
during the extreme , whether it 's the citizens of initiatives , or company into the rule on a for them in some way , extracting the part of focus has the city against the responsibility for reforestation projects that might be the edge of attention away .
and the rest of course , though the city of the projects , okay , with each other tools available to .
a <unk> initiative to make these were large-scale individuals .
also our goal was actually a temporary initiative that by their school , and unexpected happened roughly half a year to work on the results and the responsibility on the city will intuit , i wanted .
current state of a big investor in the villa out in january you bought .
you have been through negotiation .
so we have come on right now this problem for us to the responsibility , not been cast things .
but we know in any case already been that , if the city of a villa successful <unk> , if the negotiation that actually are successful that then a <unk> be done .
in what form of the place is actually more open .
in order to conclude to come and i 'm convinced of that many projects that their meaning , complexity or their expense of the city designed to be a chance of happiness endorsement of identification , making .
what if it in time , a dialog with the citizens <unk> .
in terms of the city and citizens .
in terms of the city and you all that you tonight is sitting there .
if we bring in demand and with the makers in the <unk> the citizens , no longer than just annoying to sense , but as profitable .
this is it .
last night for the rehearsal , we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> come .
we have <unk> .
so this idea , there ai n't second chance to have , if it in this life does n't work out that has to go up again , you ai n't second chance .
we identified very exciting .
and we were actually relatively quick look at all agree that it 's two things that there are n't we 'll see that we wanted .
this one is the puberty .
second thing there was also immediate run a unity of the table and again , the school ?
nah .
nah .
school , some of you may recall one more books out -- paint-by-numbers classwork .
at my job is yes , so , here are the <unk> years ago , but the words to run by me down to <unk> hands .
my neck straps herself go together and i 'll just go back to get away from the loo .
and then i know i do n't know how it on you , but in my exams , then over the of the <unk> taken seriously , he said , who was always the next to me .
no idea , what 's from actually has become .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was n't really nice and after i then my final <unk> behind me had was perfectly clear , never again , school .
and what should i 'm saying , when i on this year <unk> look back some of the nicest day , the i mean , you 've spent a piece of , have a ' i in schools have spent .
with great passion and confidence that voluntary .
how did it up ?
how could this happen ?
that began to first time with that something happens is , i do n't expect anything .
i got kids .
so , my wife was given the children .
and therefore i was then also very clear that they [ is , around these <unk> to deal with .
to the one day , when she said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today , you going down .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there 's basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt thrown in the <unk> .
that i saw the same kind of the way back at the way .
and the smell , even as interpreted as a school and then , smelly , and i <unk> ' me , like this is yes , nothing changed .
and when i then the teacher -- would say , i heard and you know , the kids learn not for school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i 'm going to my god , the sentence inside . ' i know , and then you do n't <unk> .
what is that , what we look at school , from this high point for a 's life actually picked up to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really learned .
where they 've actually in their lives <unk> ever really need to be ?
and you may have some yet , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's more time taking ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time as possible much interested in your <unk> , just , so i do it goes down button again <unk> able to me to cut it 's going ?
well , i have made of the time needed to the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what is a <unk> of one point of something about it out whether someone once a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , and if the good and diagnostic properties have ?
nah .
so , way , for a 's life , not for school us .
if we go back , i was about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , there are these yes , you voted out .
this is the time , in the in germany , the <unk> then some point entirely was introduced .
and where we also the educational system , how we now has to its roots .
and if we wanted to go back to imagine then there was actually so , people then they had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , that they 're kind of forced into action , the school to go and with knowledge is crammed into that were then we really the only way , who had to deal with the wisdom and the facts and the information their time in order to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket and as the library of the day of time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
i mean , there was something changes in the world and there were suddenly people who needs of these new machines and help us could .
the same time were also people who needs to develop these machines to wait , and repair their use .
and we needed to people who these machines to build it could put those factories were running .
maybe you see it already .
this <unk> school , that we now in germany in many digits do n't have to be its root that time .
and got a potentially make sense .
well , because it 's then probably really that was , that which i in school because i learned was ' for the work on the assembly line , well , who at the assembly line standing , the status quo because his entire life .
we do <unk> looked into the future .
so let that <unk> century , where it is , and we look at this year <unk> on .
this year <unk> was this year , there was the first <unk> just close to hurt .
i was with my study done , and i thought , now is the time , now you make you add , the first company .
yes , after some else was picking up to the internet , then <unk> ' i mean , if <unk> ' i 'm also found out .
and some corporations are at us <unk> and they were getting bigger and becoming bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow growth , and some of the companies are then at us again , so in free fall <unk> .
you see is always two times in life .
and we had then after a few years , but 30 kilometers deep .
so , we had such a wonderful growth and we had so exciting careers on board , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai n't side and what you have , what these people do , but i went into the school was we had no idea that it 's so what would be .
even when i <unk> did was of things like the internet is not a speech .
and the children are today in the improved schooling . what good job , they get into ten , six , or 30 years of ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and what you know , what data will need to in those future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , well , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we degree , so in the future looking , who could be me because the <unk> going on saturday .
there <unk> ticket , have a ' i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how do we go out what to school for a 's lives learning how you ?
what are some of things that we need to kids to get away from being unfit to do ?
and maybe help people like a look at in this , what companies today on staff to look .
that this is yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are coming up in the company .
and if you look like this ai n't traditional , <unk> looking at the right , then it says there at first place , yes , so what , like the expertise .
there are interested in the yes , so the check out and so , which we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and about 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school right now , and also in the future ca n't afford .
what school , but maybe i do n't afford to be able to things are , the more important to be , are the something called <unk> <unk> and i am firmly believe that that these <unk> <unk> the lemonade <unk> the future will be .
and the you can basically in three different ways to summarize .
this is one , who want in their employees , the scalable , are , so , flexibility in this is a .
then you want to be almost all their employees to be entrepreneurial thinking .
and then you want to these companies on staff , the <unk> are .
so we have flexibility and leaders , thinking and predicts that .
so , starting with the flexibility in .
this is relatively easy to comprehend .
if we look , how economies to work , how fast , yes , how fast is all change .
<unk> , the whole business models are by the internet of today , on tomorrow are turned upside down .
because i need bees ' i workers who these changes can deal .
because i need bees ' i workers who are creative .
because i need bees ' i staff , the <unk> are .
this is quite the exact opposite of what in the factory end of <unk> century of collaborators at the assembly line carried with .
also the second subject of this entrepreneurial think is fairly obvious .
because it gets to the responsibility .
because it gets to people to take responsibility .
first of themselves , and their own life .
but also for the greater whole .
if this now this company is , or even when society , wishing that we have people to take responsibility for the greater whole .
and the third thing that predicts who becomes almost the most <unk> .
and if we wanted to soccer cup , remember , then we did for the web and this beautiful saying .
argentina , has <unk> <unk> portugal was <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't khalid <unk> , the world cup you have made .
that were able to the only in common .
and also , so this , this big energy innovator -- our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was not , of the iphone , up , who has not the <unk> invented , who has to itunes n't invented , who did n't know invented .
the had a team that possible this has done , because just as a team had the it eventually what they did .
so this ai at school , these three things to try to be able to play in , but this ai at school , where we for a 's lives learning .
but there <unk> fourth item and the is me almost more important .
and this is a learner himself .
if only thing , what we think about the future with certainty that we can tell is that it into uncertainty is then it 's the ability to keep a new to learn and enjoy it 's having this learning to experience is paramount , that we in the future life , and that our children in the future life are successful .
that play . ' yet it ai at school , the kinds of transcendence .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and most of them , who have kids who know that 's not just this ai event is , for the you <unk> pay you have .
so this ai event like a lot of like all it said , but not yet from each other .
to the point where <unk> get elected , there are then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and what can i say , at the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> even the fun part of this event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you look like the stress , around the subject of homework and learn that the whole family life <unk> .
and much less fun makes it , if the kid was sick staff is , because in school , stress this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of these <unk> at this school is again , so 'n <unk> .
in fact , it was no <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , so immediately after the last time , and in fact , we were also the single parents who were invited .

<unk> are , but two years , where we noticed they have , because if you do anything or not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we 'd actually the question is our child , fail ?
and we 're only ones who do it go ?
now have sex pistols ' i in the last two years , since i 'm in the theme involved with lots of people who spoke and we have sex pistols ' i discovered that way i ' learned , you 're not alone .

and what can i say , he gave me almost the same story with his kids , he almost the same is construed as we , and that we had been fortunate that our children there 's take off from school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's hand , ai <unk> at different schools and we could actually , charter into account .
but can that anyone out there are doing ?
somehow was us that too little , just our children in safety to put that proper out there 's how to make a way they are .
and after we 're both right now the sensation having to school has happened since we were there was not really changed , we thought , yeah well , we are the first , the topic that 's time heart attack .
is , what shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
this is the good that we deceive you have .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast this ai whole range of amazing people found that 's a similar to how we know , ai to create that all of them up to be .
it 's probably not so that only ones and their parents lying under the suffering which comes out there 's often happens .
if we are teachers to see , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look , but it turned the number <unk> in the last decade has changed who has doubled .
it can now be that all parents were wrong ?
that all children dying is , and that kind of all those teachers to crash is ?
or it may be that we have a school have to do n't come true anymore , right , like that <unk> ago <unk> years , the fit just not true anymore , right .
and we have many people found , where the way , and went and we even people found that not have children .
and they 've figured out that they become committed to the future that they become committed to the future , showing you take responsibility for that which we our children and the kids , the right now in the go to school , with on the way .
and we were at <unk> second point gotten there are out there ai whole range of ladies on the initiatives , the school change you want , and there are there <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost on every school teachers who really involved are and the difference , will .
and you even the one or bold principal , the go up again <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had to say no concept that we then i 'm going to help us could .
but we can one thing to do , we can into those schools to go and we can in these schools , people , the school like , so the parents , the teachers and the students , bringing them and we can use them into two days , ai n't quite done .
there are coming from people together , in the past , rather than against each have worked and the learning in two days , what it means we relate to work .
the come with <unk> of concrete challenge of them together to solve .
and after two kind of days have the then take a new <unk> evolve or the gun and made for this ai n't totally new to high as we have some of the berlin who are problems are empowered .
or they did a concrete actions on bullying problems that you in their school , we 've developed .
in two days in developed new approaches , the next day i immediately be realized .
but what this fabulous thing , what about these two days , what happens , and that makes it for me and so beautiful , the small weekends , the i ' , then the same time in schools across all of germany to spend , is that energy , the then arises when the three things to learn .
if the three things together to experience , because things like flexibility wiped out .
so sort of leaders , thinking and if you may be an interdisciplinary team to experience .
then is that a spark off the <unk> .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop to look like this ai in schools back then you know , we thing when the school as a whole -- that has , to change that there ai n't completely different cultures actually formed .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> ' they 'll invite one of school to think .
i <unk> ' they 'll invite men , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' they all about also invited to talk , through school , to speak .
you 're talking about this , what you like , but you 're talking also that at what you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much for comfort they get , and how many people are taking the have experienced , but just not talking about .
let me in every school in germany , into <unk> century out .
let 's the entire system .
and let 's done together with the people to school day for the day , and see with your parents , the teachers and the students .
because all collectively we can it eventually .
thank you .
