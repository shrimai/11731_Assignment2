you know , one of the big <unk> make journeys and one of the joys to <unk> research is , along with the people to live , who are still in the old days you can remember . of their history , still in the wind ' , you on the rain <unk> rocks can touch , you in the bitter the leaves the plants ' delicious .
just that know that <unk> even beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myth the oldest the inuit -- more filled with meaning is , or that in the himalayas and the buddhists reflect levels still the breath of <unk> track which means , at the root , revelation of physical anthropology research into memory to scream , that 's the idea that the world , where we live , not in a total of the cars , but just as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of a particular ways of an adaptation of our ancestors , <unk> successful , with many generations of chose .
and needless to share , we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we teach kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to the <unk> separation from the death on afterwards and thus should it 's not surprise that we all of music , dancing and and art to convince them .
but it 's interesting is the unique cadence of <unk> , the rate of dance in every culture .
so doing plays it does n't matter , whether it around the <unk> in the woods of borneo , is on , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> right into the sahara . this is , by the other guy , but when i 'm a month ago in the desert , across my own . or even a <unk> at the hanging of <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways , other ways to the orientation behavior on earth there .
and this is an idea that , if you think about to keep using only hope that somehow i can .
together , the <unk> cultures , the world a net sticking out <unk> and cultural life , this is wrapped up for the basis of the ground just as important is how that biological <unk> that is a biosphere does .
and you are this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can help when the sum of thoughts and dreams , myths and ideas , of inspirations -- and intuition , from the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness has produced by to be defined .
the <unk> is the big legacy of humanity .
it 's this symbol at all , what we 're and why we 're an amazing <unk> species are able to .
and just like the biosphere , for women wear away from being done this with the <unk> -- just to be even bigger faster .
not a biologist , dignity for example , dare to say that 50 percent or more all species on the brink of extinction are , because it just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of biodiversity -- we can hardly the , what we as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity is now known .
and the truth of useful for that is extinct in the languages .
than any of them in this room was born , have been around for 6,000 different languages spoken .
now is a language not just the totality of the vocabulary or a series of <unk> .
a language is the expression of human mind .
it 's a tool , with the soul of a certain cultures have access to the material world finds .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual and opportunities .
and of that are 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey , sit , exactly half the work in the ears of children with whispered it .
they are what infants do n't even taught . i mean , if anything being done , they 're actually already died .
what might be lonely be , as being silent in the country , to be one of your people to be that your language to speak , no way to have to the wisdom of the ancestors of science , or a hopeful that kids to occur ?
and yet you get this horrible destiny , somebody somewhere on earth , i think about . every two weeks , because of two weeks , die an older people and take the last <unk> from an historic language at the grave .
and i know some of you say it 's not better way ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to talk to go ? '' and i say `` well , let this language , yoruba person . let them <unk> be .
let them kogi . ''
and then they would suddenly realize how to be , if your own language not speak up .
so i want you today , sort of a trip across the <unk> away , a quick trip across the <unk> to try to give meaning out to do , which actually been lost is .
now there some of us , the sense , forget that i , when i say different ways of being , '' truly different ways of being mean .
take you take this kid , the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the nation of the anaconda , believe that they <unk> the <unk> the middle east around the belly of sacred , snakes <unk> .
this is a people , which is not being cognitively between the colored blue , and green is different , because that <unk> the forest , from where people were attached to <unk> is .
they have an idiosyncratic , language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called `` you have to marry someone who 's another language to speak .
so all this is rooted in the mythological past . this curious about this big houses where its <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , but what is that you never find somebody 's listening to the an animal learns language .
they 'll just to and start off to speak .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes , with whom i ever have lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first came back in 1958 , peaceful and contact being done .
in the year 1957 , trying to five of missionaries came into contact model and made a bad things wrong .
they threw a sparkling photos of themselves from the air down , what we as a kind , gesture for figuring out . at forgetting that you that these people from the rainforest in their lives never heard something <unk> had seen .
they took these photographs from the ground up , along behind the face or the character to see , find anything , concluding that this business cards of the devil . be and removing the five of missionaries with the spear .

they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths were happening through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two times is a natural death and when we had people with very forcibly , something about <unk> , gave them to tell , one of people that old economy was that he 's because it 's all ages , died , and we would kill him still with the spear .
but once they had an explicit -- knowledge of forests , the amazing happened .
they were hunters who were able to the urine of an animal 's from 40 step away you smell and name , to whichever of animal that was theirs .
in the early <unk> years , i was quite an amazing job , as me my professor at harvard , he said , if i 'm interested in would , in haiti , to go and the secret societies to infiltrate the ones that the foundation of magnitude of <unk> and <unk> <unk> were and the venom , that it was used to look at zombies making sure .
about this sensation -- a sense to give you must naturally i talk about this remarkable think of <unk> know , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
the opposite , it actually is a complex of metaphysical at the world .
it 's interesting .
if i asked you would , the major religions , on sale , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because the presumption , was that it in sub-saharan africa is n't religious faith , most of course there was an and voodoo 's just the remnant of these very <unk> religious thought that during the tragic diaspora , the <unk> <unk> .
but what voodoo so interesting , is that there are living connection between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirit .
the spirit can of them under the great age of evoking going to answer to the rate of dance to the soul of course , the moment to think about , so that the <unk> for a short , this glittering moment to god will .

we go dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you 're obsessed with your moment , you get from the spirit of services . how you do harm caused by side ?

now , of all of people that i 've met , were of kogi from the sierra nevada and de santa <unk> in <unk> , most exceptional .
offspring , the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> coastal from colombia , populated , and in a series of conquest , wandering around that people in a <unk> volcanic rapidly go back , that about the <unk> coastal smoke .
in a <unk> continent who were these people not only ones who never of the <unk> conquered .
to present day , they hit by a ritual priesthood is king . the training to priesthood , but it 's quite exceptional .
the young <unk> be at age three and four years of their families , separate and in a <unk> world , the dark , in <unk> at a fab the glacier , for 18 years separated . two periods of factors of nine years , deliberately chose to the nine months of pregnancy emulate , the in her lap , to be reunited mother used to spend so what you <unk> in the fold the big mother .
and during that all over time , they are culturally and in the scores of their society into place . values , the claim that sustain that their prayer , and only their prayer , the cosmic scene -- or we can say that environmental issues -- the balance the web .
the end of these amazing <unk> you 'll someday , suddenly i went out of and i first in their lives , at age 17 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of light , when the sun 's starting on the <unk> 's astonishingly beautiful place to radiation , which is becoming suddenly everything , what they in abstract 've learned in scale of scale , confirmed . and the preacher starts back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , as i 'm told you .
it 's so beautifully . you have it to protect them . ''
they call out the older brother and say that we are the younger brother is , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we at some indigenous and the landscape of thinking , <unk> we 're either <unk> and the old one of gossip of fancy , wild up , which is in his simplification of <unk> idea is right hand thoreau and say , the people are more with the natural connection , when we .
so , then aboriginal are n't sentimental , even get out of nostalgia , compromised .
it does n't much space that in the <unk> swamps , of <unk> or the cold twist of tibet , they have , but nevertheless , through time and my ritual in a seemingly mysterious <unk> the world shaped , the not on the idea is based on your close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth in itself just existing channels in , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , what is that ?
it means that a little girl from the andes , in the belief that grows , that the mountain in a <unk> is , of his or her destiny to say , is a very different person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place that have , as a little girl from montana , in the belief that grows , that a mountain under a bunch of stone is , who wear can be .
if he 's the abode of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
interesting thing is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew in the woods by british columbia . on and i believed that these forests that there are , <unk> to be .
it made me to a different people as my friends in the <unk> , who believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> spirit people are , the most <unk> the world to live , spirit people who you get your <unk> teach you would .
now , if you start to the idea of looking at that these cultures , various new realities of creating it can , you can make some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . for example of these plant here .
it 's a photo , that i just last april , in the northwest of the amazon detected .
this is an ayahuasca , a lot of you 've heard that powerful personalize interfaces on top of his repertoire of the shamans live .
what ayahuasca so fascinating , is not only the <unk> potential that <unk> , but with the information processing . it 's really for two different sources . on the one hand , there are these wooden <unk> , the a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , slightly hallucinogenic to hold . this <unk> solo play is something like to be a blue <unk> smoke at their minds put them , it , but with the leaves a <unk> from the family of <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> mix them .
these plant that includes some very strong <unk> the idea of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you ever the <unk> 've seen so , this stuff snorting , this substance of them from various ways to create permanent entity that also <unk> .
this <unk> to themselves snorting 's like from a <unk> throw down , <unk> of the baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man , the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years , gave up again , discussing . i said , that you <unk> not as highly hallucinogenic to categorize it was able to be in the moment where you the effects , feels , you may not there is to a <unk> to experience .
but the thing with <unk> is that they do n't , orally to be obtained can , because they have a in the human bowels of course <unk> enzyme that with names <unk> , <unk> .
you can only with several different chemicals , orally to be obtained , the mao <unk> .
now it 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> those are , <unk> of the same kind of those who is necessary to the <unk> to <unk> . ask yourself so even .
how these people from one of wildlife by 80,000 species <unk> plant these two , morphologically just let 's relatives come to find that , if this way , combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?

but you get asked the indians , they said , `` the plant that speaks to us . ''
so , what is that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , has 17 different varieties of ayahuasca that they all around the great distance in the forest is recognizing that for our eyes , as sort of stuff .
and then get asked them , like your taxonomy arguably , and they say `` i thought , you understand something from plants .
i mean , you know anything ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that any of 17 different varieties , in <unk> absolute and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
well , this brings them not a ph.d. at harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
well , this <unk> the problem is that even those of us , the concerns of the tricky position of indigenous people , they were <unk> and colorful , you 're making any kind of the past , hedge fund , during the physical world , we ought to our world , progresses .
so , in fact that you look at the 20th century . , in 300 years , not for your war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era , where we <unk> were and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity around for either way an ounce of there are passive accepted . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have kept on the dance with new <unk> participating .
and the problem is not the technology in itself .
the <unk> and then they 're not less on the sioux nation to be , when you a bow , and the arrow of tasks , as the americans who stopped americans to be , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
do n't change and technology would threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face the rule .
and wherever anybody you are in the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not the sinking <unk> are . this is dynamic , living people , whose existence through the visible to rediscover the ultrasound will be about their capacity to adapt to go . whether it turns out to the vast possibilities to deforestation in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a nation , the front of a generation freely in the forest , living , and now to <unk> , prostitution , the river letting stuff was , where you can see that even the river with mud , polluted going to the almost half of borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . from where the japanese <unk> on the horizon , to see are , who are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill in which they are the forest , whisked you have . or how in the case <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we in the mountains of tibet and go , where i recently much work , you will become the ugly face the political and dominance of those .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's generally and sentenced to , but the <unk> , the destruction of lived from the people who will not just not be convicted , but generally , and <unk> as part of a <unk> celebrated .

i traveled all , with a young artist colleagues are 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> after the lhasa and only when i went to the lhasa came , i saw the face of the statistics from which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , the in the rubble , ashes in turn back . 1.2 million people that during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed .
the father watched this young couple of fitting started as followers , of <unk> lama and identified .
this meant that would look at the chinese invasion of behavior and killed down .
his uncle fled to their sanctity in the diaspora , people in nepal , did .
his mother was locked up , more unusual punishment to -- for the crime as wealthy to be .
he was at age two years in the prison smuggled to be under your <unk> to hide , because they do without him no life could .

one day she entered the workers put on an rfid mao , and for these <unk> she had to seven years in a heavy , labor .

and the end up , that we really a choice . we 've set up in a <unk> world of this monotony , or in a <unk> world of diversity of life ?
margaret mead , the great . anthropologist who said before they died , that it their greatest fear is that as we place to a thread , <unk> , generic drugs at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination at a <unk> mindset , reduced going to see , but that we one day from a dream to wake up , and i 've forgotten to think it ever the other ways we have .
and it 's really humbling to remember that our species , perhaps been 600,000 years , exist .
the <unk> revolution , us the agriculture started , and us that was when the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the shamans live with his prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization of surplus , created -- i found was just 10,000 years , instead .
the modern industrial world as we know it 's hardly see 300 years old .
now , this was superficial history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges have , we 're in the next for millennia face .
if we are <unk> <unk> after the importance of human questions , answering them with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song is going to the ability to rediscover that to be , what we are : people who would run awareness about the importance of this is that all people and gardens for a space , are being able to <unk> must be . and there 's great moments of the optimism .

that canada’s national government is not always very well with the inuit usage , and during the <unk> years as part of the establishment of our regime , they were forced me , in new settlement into account .
the granddaddy of this old man who refused to be .
the family , the fear to be life was , took him all of guns and all the tools that .
now you have to know that the inuit -- not afraid of the cold . they used them their benefit .
the <unk> their <unk> was originally from fish , the in <unk> wrapped up , created .
the granddaddy of man 's worried that are not on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .

he <unk> saliva , on the pages of <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog that .

so you can take nothing to do something .
and this is in many ways of a symbol of the resistance of the inuit -- and all indigenous park in the world .
that canada’s national government was the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control of an area again , that 's bigger than california , texas .
it 's our new home country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's an independent . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state of atonement with its people , that we search and you get .
and ultimately , i think , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , the that would be pulled the aim the earth , traveled around , to realize that they all away .
they are the <unk> from someone else .
they represent the parts of the human imagination , the in times past <unk> . and for all of us to be the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we do with national geographic and ultimately , trying to do is that we think politicians will never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> no conclusive , is , but we believe that storytelling and the world can change and so we 're probably the best of the institution for storytelling in the world . our website you 've got 35 million hits every month .
156 nations , sending our tv channel .
our science magazines migrate to millions who read .
and we do a series of travel in the <unk> , put in our audience to places of such as cultural and amazed to take them to be about that looked at are blinded , and hopefully , they become a time the root , revelation of physical anthropology , i suppose : that this world has earned he said , on different ways to exist , that we have a <unk> in a very multicultural <unk> world can find , in the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
what i 'm going to first , as soon as possible , going to show , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft , as part of a <unk> ago exactly one year , given to have this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in either you locally , right away with huge amounts of visual information can deal .
we see many , gigabytes of digital photographs here , that you would blend seamlessly , and ongoing <unk> , pan , at any way to be arrangements that can .
and it 's any way of information that we look , how large that collections is , or how big the images are .
most of you 're digital flash a camera , but this is for example , a scan of the lessons and it 's in the realm of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because only thing , what the performance of the system like this very constrained can , is the number of a pixel in your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , an example <unk> .
this is <unk> house of , dickens was . every column , is a chapter .
to prove that it actually a text and not make a picture is , we can be about how do that they to really show that that 's an actual representation of <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial nature , a <unk> to read .
i would n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the enjoyment and the good experience a real <unk> a newspaper or a newspaper to read , what about a sort of medium with several scales is .
we also something on the corner of these special edition of the guardian .
we have a false experience with very high <unk> designed , who are much higher than with a regular experience is , and we 've added the content , added .
if you the functions that you want to see , you can see here .
or different models , or even a technical specifications .
and this cell really these ideas on , these constraints of the knowledge square on the screen to stop .
we hope that does n't add pop-ups and other nonsense over a means -- that should n't need to be .
now is that mapping of the really obvious ways for a technology like this .
and i 'd like this really not much time , though , except to say that we also to this room can contribute to be .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> at the top <unk> picture at nasa .
let 's something else out .
now this is actually live in the internet . they could scrutiny .
this is a project with the name photosynth , that really two different technologies , connecting .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good the research on <unk> , the story <unk> , a university students from university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> at the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research has done before . a very good working together .
so that 's live in the internet . it 's some <unk> driven .

but the spatial constellation of imagery is here in fact that of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together to be written them from the real space , where this footage that all around the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies , were designed to meet . you see pieces of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in the relationship with another set .
i 'm not sure , if i time still have you very different environments to show .
there is that much <unk> are .
i wanted to look straight into the original pieces of the story to show and this is an early prototype of photosynth , where we first time in summer you 've been working on them to do this , what i think it really the punch line of this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not necessarily so obvious , if you the environments , looking at that we 're going on the webpage has .
we had to us all the lawyers , etc . you care .
this is a reconstructed of the seed cathedral notre dame , the only in the computer with images from flickr inception . give them to notre dame , on flickr , and they 're taking pictures of men in a t-shirt and on the <unk> etc . get . any of those colored orange <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so they 're all of this <unk> , and they all stand in perspective that way in the relationship with another .
and we can take these very simple way to navigate .
so you know , i never believed that i end up at microsoft actually going .
i 'm very grateful for a reception in here .
so i suspect , you can see that many different kinds of cameras are : everything is that , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a very large number of them , the all in this environment patched me .
and when they can , i 'm going to some of weird place .
many of you 're from facial covered up on .
somewhere here 's a series of photographs -- it 's them .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , right thing was recording made .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment to change .
the point is here , that we do with the social background stuff . it will now data from all the 10 years -- of the whole collective of memory of them , like , visual at the world looks -- and everything is connected .
all these photographs are connected , and there will be something that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that from around the earth 's walls .
and look at that as the sequel to work of forces , <unk> of virtual earth .
and this is something that through the complexity , with the people use it , growing and its use for the user , with the app that 's always gets bigger .
their own photos are going to have metadata <unk> , the another person being made .
if you get the trouble was doing , and look at that saint of them identified by and share becomes who you 're all , and it 's my photo of the notre <unk> suddenly , with all these data , held and i can you as a starting to use around in this room to dive , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use and so a kind of more broadly <unk> social experience with the use of the other players doing .
and of course , the byproduct of this at all are extremely rich , virtual models of any interesting part of the ground , the not just by <unk> or a satellite and so forth , then we were , but through collective of memory .
thank you .
so i understanding you right ? their software that controls that to some period , within the next year , all images which comes from someone in the world together to be used in principle , linked together to be ?
yes . they do nothing more than finding out .
if you want to put them to hyperlinks , between the slides .
and they 're doing this based on the content in the slides .
and this is really exciting , if you at the amount of semantic information i think of a lot of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they sentences as input and the text , the webpage has a lot of information about what 's a picture this is .
but how would , if this picture of them with all its images , connecting ?
then is the circumference of semantic <unk> and the wealth of about it makes , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , this is really incredible , congratulations .
they have , thanks .
i 'll give some things from a book about the one , i hope , in accordance with other things are you 've already heard . and i 'll try to a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't notice are .
i want to begin with which i 'd have official dogma binding . '' i call .
the official dogma binding on what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like when our desire to maximize the dwelling our own citizens , which is this in particular through the <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the reasons it is that freedom within itself is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> requirement for the human .
if human freedoms that we have , then it 's all of us for itself around the things to do that our common good to maximize and nobody has to us to decide .
the way of freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize returns .
the more choices , people , more i freedom of them . and more you the freedoms they have to the more common good for them .
this is , i think , so deeply into our water , so indefinitely , that 's not in the sense to happen , it to ask questions .
and it 's too deep inside our lives , they 're taught .
i 'll give some examples give , what we can be more progress by itself .
this is my supermarket . not much .
i 'd just briefly about <unk> say .

so this is , like the grocery store is .
and then they 're going to the <unk> business for a good stereo at to put together -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , it 's imagination-amplifier . and on this one of electronics business , there 's how many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of <unk> plants , put together , from the components that in a world , there are offered .
you must admit that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time , as i was a boy was , because you could every phone , the vendor would have the you wanted to long as he had -- ma he showed up .
they have your phone <unk> . they would n't <unk>
a result was that the phone ever broken , was .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite selection of your phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the cellphone , the future .
and my favorite is the in the center -- <unk> , <unk> and some crème <unk> torch around .
and they should be the far right now , in your business and i 've seen , you can be sure that they 'll soon .
and what it does it 's going to get people in the businesses to go and this question to ask .
you know now what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a mobile to buy , that 's not too much does .
in other aspects of life , the very becomes far as this purchase of objects are , meets the same explosion of choices too .
health -- it 's no longer the case in the united states that you to medical attention to go and the doctor says , you 're going to do is .
instead they 're going to one-on-one tutoring and the doctor says , you : we could a to make or we could call b .
and i got these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , so what i do ? ''
the doctor says , b has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , doc , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- that 's called `` patient , autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shifting the burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone could n't know -- namely the doctor -- to someone who does n't know , and likely that 's ill and therefore , it in the best and constitution , is a decision to meet -- namely the patient .
there 's a tremendous marketing , for <unk> drug for people like you and i , that , if you think about , any sense of power , because we do n't buy .
why this force your help us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is : you expect of us the doctor in the next morning call and make a change of prescription to ask .
something so profound way our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide show you want .
we heir not an identity , we make them .
and we reinvent ourselves as often be as we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning , wake up , you to decide which for a kind of person you might want .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time , in the <unk> was that almost every one had and the way you get married soon as you could , and so easily kids were given how they could .
the only true of choice , `` who '' do n't know when , and not what they then we 've done .
nowadays everything is easy to have .
i teach , wonderful animals , students , and i leave you 20 percent less effort and when i once did .
and that 's not because they 're smart are , and not because they 're more carefully .
it 's because they 're in other things are engaged , you ask yourself , `` should i married , or not ? should i 'm going to marry ?
should i went to marry ? should i 've only have kids , or more career i do ? ''
they 're all <unk> questions .
and they are going to answer questions matter if that means that all the tasks to do that i find them <unk> and no good note in my class , to get .
and in fact that should you have done . this is important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl illustrates is , with the technology that allows us every minute of every day from any place on the planet to work -- the way on the <unk> hotel .
there are actually a corner , of the i did n't tell going to go in the <unk> works .
i 'm going to do you do n't tell , because i was actually want .
so what it means , this extraordinary freedom of choice we have in terms of work decisions to meet , and again , and again , if we work should n't work should .
we can our children with the football games to look , and we have our mobile phone at a hip , and your blackberry , in your hip , and our laptop is probably going on your lap .
and even though they shut down there are , every minute , where we our child at <unk> a soccer watching . we ask ourselves as well , `` i was this call would ?
i tried to this email answers ? i was this letter writing ? ''
and even though the answer to the question `` no , '' is it will be sure their experience of <unk> their children , cloaking them very different than it would have been .
the place where we look , great things and little things that material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world where we lived looked like .
so i want to say , there was a few options , but not it was a question of choice .
and the world where we now live looks like .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes .
we all know what good about this is , so i 'll talk about what 's bad about this is .
all these choices are two effects , two or negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , is that he 's hamstringing going to be free .
with so many options out of you choose to be able to cut down there are very hard to look at all to decide .
i 'm going to them another <unk> examples give , a study about investing in volunteers cashed in .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> from about one million u.s. employees and i think about . 2000 , so different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> of employers who offered to take the participation in order of living off .
they 're offering 50 <unk> about -- 10 percent fewer people taking part of as if you just five their dignity . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are , the time dealing with , it 's too hard to decide what you choose to make it on tomorrow delayed .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know that 's not just means that people <unk> need to eat when you in the retirement , go , because they 're not enough money to swim hundreds have , it also means that make decisions that hard is that it 's great <unk> her employer to miss .
by the n't have gone to give them into millennia of the u.s. dollars per year on of the major employer , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis , is a consequence of too many options .
and i think it 's worried that the world looks like .
they like the decision really hit , if it for all ages is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment a fund them , or even the fake <unk> .
so this is an effect . the other side effect is that even if we the lesion of breaking and make a decision to end unless we 're more satisfied with the result of choice , as if we get the opportunity had we could lead us between the less ability to decide .
and there are several reasons for this .
one chimp is reduced by the large selection of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and which <unk> 's been perfect ? it 's just imagine that it 's another decision , if you can make the better would have been . and what happens is this image is that imagined alternative that leads to make the decision to regret , and that we regret that looks a negative impact on the average happiness which they are from their impacts the decision was , well , if it 's a decision was .
the more opportunities there , the less simpler , it 's anything to regret that 's so disappointing for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> .
dan , gilbert 's a big point this morning done by was telling how much the way in the we evaluate things , it 's due to what we compare .
well , if it 's lots of alternatives to think there , it 's just any more attractive , traits to picture of alternatives that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that they voted out .
here 's an example . for most of them , the no new yorker is , apologize for me .
but here is what they would think about all .
here 's a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous , the beach . great day . they all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood , is gone .
i could front of my house park . ''
and he spent two weeks of the thought to follow that he the opportunity again , he said , day about the day , a great car to have .
<unk> reduce the great satisfaction that we created by our choice and then , well , if this is what we chose to have tremendous job is .
and more opportunities there for a selection available , the more attractive , the quality of these choices be in the <unk> account .
here 's another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the now to live , but i think about things are starting to do .
but a good , the he does is , and who you look for one thing to decide , you decide to each other things not to do .
and these other things like most attractive properties have , and it will , they 're going to be more appealing to do .
three : the escalation of the expectations .
that i was met , when i my jeans exchange wanted .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in it just designer jeans is a kind of , and they have you bought , and they were bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you take long enough to the globe and often enough clean up , they started out , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i was about new jeans is to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the counter said , `` want you lean people , slightly <unk> or the ocean ?
you want to do buttons , or <unk> ? rock or acid would clean water ?
you want jeans , with holes ?
want them down from where we cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and so forth and he told .
my jaw , was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like the way , the past the only way that was . ''

i 'd better than this . look at that choice has made it 's better to have .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it myself to explain .
the reason that i began feeling was , with all this available resources , my high expectations of what for good a few jeans is like , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no particular expectations , when they just in a kind of .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn , one of you would be perfect , so ,
and what i got was okay , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compared me what i have had to the what i expected , and what i had been so disappointing results in the relative to the what i expected .
this add some ways in the life people increases that inevitably the expectations , people are about how great opportunities that will be .
and this leads to any satisfaction to the results , though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing manager knows that 's because , if they would , you knew what they all not my point about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything was better than anything worse , than anything worse , it was to people can experience to make the a nice , surprise was .
now , in the world where we live -- we 're wealthy , the industrialized citizens , with perfect one than expecting -- the best for that you ever was hoping we can is this is how things are good for how it of you anticipated .
they 're not comfortable by surprise . because their hopes , my high expectations , <unk> are .
the secret to <unk> -- this is what they all come this is -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i 'd say -- for a little <unk> moment -- that i do with one woman got married my time , and it 's really beautifully .
i would n't do better . i 'm not <unk> .

finally , a consequence of to remove a bad sitting jeans , if it only one way to get there is that when she was discontented with are , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans , are available , and they buy one of anticlimactic . is , and they ask why , who 's charge ?
it 's also clear that the answers to the question is , you .
they 'd better than this can do .
by 100 different kinds of jeans , in the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results from the decisions are good , it feels disappointed about , they blame itself .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think some whopping -- not the only , but some whopping <unk> to this explosion of depression , and nor suicide , this is that people have experienced the disappointing . are because their standards , so high . and then , when you 're all these experiences himself will tell you need to think it would your fault .
and this is <unk> that it 's generally better go to be objective , and we began feeling .
so let me if you .
this is the official dogma in which is that one that we all of the best , which is wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no doubt that some selection is better than any , but now i 'm not , that more selection is better than a choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we that long did i miss at some draw your welfare program improved .
now , as a policy question -- i 'm almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking is . that 's all these selection itself in the industrialized societies , is the material that wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we went from a lot of you 've heard , their problem is not the way too large selection is .
your problem is that they do n't have .
so the things about the i 'm talking about is an odd problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what 's too frustrating and angry , is : steve levitt would have here yesterday about it tells how this is more expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that these fancy vacations , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy , that they do n't help .
they do n't actually hurt .
they worry about it that we got worse , standing there .
if something about what the people in our society that allows us to have choices , to come to the societal collapses for people too much choice has shifted , you could not only the life of people really improves , but we would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> application .
<unk> will be sure that everybody 's better go -- not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us is plaguing .
finally , read me this cartoon , and , a refined in person , says , `` ah ! what have this fish ?
you know it as possible in this <unk> . ''
generationally imagination , which is shortsighted , the way the world -- and that 's the way i was reluctant was reading .
the more of but i thought about , the more i went over the view , that the fish do n't know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> bonds , so that everything is possible , they do n't have freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> bonds , so that everything is possible to reduce your happiness .
they 're stepping out of paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost like he readily available for sure to be limited -- perhaps some for the fish , definitely use .
but that <unk> be a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for the agony , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i have some of these projects before talking , about the human genome and what that could mean , and over the discovery of new tool groups of genes .
indeed we turn of a new thing : we have the biology is strips and now we try to the digital code within a new phase of biology to get to make new life create , and build .
we have been trying to great questions to ask .
what 's life ? it 's kind of which i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and this on different floors .
we have different approaches tried to make it except the minimum of the components to simplify it .

now we 're trying to ask if we live to regenerate them or whether we new life create , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of a species has been keeping herself in the lab to replicate themselves can . and we tried to see if we do with an even smaller genome , you can achieve .
we 've been able to put on about a hundred genes to get rid of the 500 , or so , these are .
but if we wanted those metabolic map , i mean , the very simple is , based on our ceramics . you can trust me , this is straightforward . but if we all those genes , i mean that we one time dealing can it 's very unlikely that 's a living cell , you 're going .
so we decided to think it 's only way to look forward is that chromosome one way to synthesize that what allows us the individual elements to <unk> and so a couple of those fundamental question to ask .
and so we started at the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize that ?
it 's allowed the chemistry of these really big molecule has happened to what you 've never been done ?
and , if we can do that , we can that chromosome start ?
a chromosome one way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our actions at the digitization , of life were exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write this has been evolving very slowly but still turn up . and our final point is now , of an exponential curve down .
we 've got 15 years ago started .
it was actually a few years with posing a <unk> review , before we the first experiments that made .
it turns is <unk> very difficult .
there are tens of machines , around the world , the little pieces of dna can manufacture , 30 to 50 characters a long , but it 's a <unk> process , so as any longer you a piece of power , the more error is happening .
so we had a new way up with the we are those pieces together and the error correct their use .
this is our first attempt , starting with the digital data , of the genome that phi x 174 countries .
it 's a virus that the bacteria , kill .
we created little bits made a <unk> and had a dna molecule of approximately 5,000 letters .
most exciting time , came when we this piece <unk> chemical to take and in a bacterium , gave me , and this bacterium has made the genetic code to read and went viral particles .
the viral particle charges were then of the cells and homesteaders , and came back and killed , e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> spoke and they said that you this model of <unk> .
they were laughing , more than you see here , does .
so we think that a situation is in the software , your hardware we can build a biological systems .
but we wanted a lot more to go . we want a whole <unk> chromosome , building . it has more than <unk> letters of genetic code . so we wanted , we 're putting it into these tapes , from the size of the virus is where we the size of tapes <unk> able to understand what the individual elements of a living cells are .
design is key , and if you 're using digital data point in the computer to start to have this digital data pretty accurate .
when we the genome for the first in 1995 , have sequenced the <unk> in a mistake per 10,000 pairs .
we found in <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence to use it would it would never been possible <unk> .
one part of design is it , we chose to create the 50 letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap need to get smaller <unk> to build this together .
we have a unique elements of this is built .
you might have heard that we <unk> built out .
you think about it for : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> these letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino ; and there 's a single , why you for each of these amino acids .
so we can the genetic code use our words are trying to write sentences , thoughts .
initially we 've only signed .
some people who were frustrated that it 's not have poetry was .
we have the pieces , constructed so that we just look at the enzyme , break off . there are enzymes are this repair and to stitch back .
and we 've started we chose to create , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> characters a rocket , adding those together to <unk> to make it turns out that liquid together , to <unk> .
in every step we have these pieces in the surplus of stuff that we sequence them could , because we tried a very robust process to create what it in a minute , i 'll see .
and we tried to the period of <unk> to go .
so , it looks like a <unk> .
if we to these really great little pieces are getting -- with over 100,000 pairs of -- i 'll all these are not just in e. coli that grow . it will exceed , all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and this technique we other policy mechanisms to .
we knew about a mechanism of <unk> recombinations to call this is going to the biology is used to dna to fix , these pieces of the key ideas can .
here 's an example of them . there 's an organism is called <unk> <unk> the three million cycle of light that survived .
you see in the upper wing area that his chromosome , just one hole falling .
twelve percent by 24 hours later , has all over again , put together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms do that can .
these organisms that can totally parched going to you can even in a vacuum .
i 'm absolutely certain that live in space there , and be able to move , on the lookout for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that it 's lots of there 's out .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by using these things have used -- actually , we 've just <unk> used to the right design the ones that we 've <unk> . yeast and momentarily and then automatically .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
it 's such a big molecule that we actually do with the <unk> can see .
that 's footage of a period of six seconds .
this is the publication the we just recently finished that have asked .
this is about <unk> letters of <unk> code . it 's the largest molecule , with <unk> structure that ever dreamed of people who was created .
it 's a <unk> of over 300 million .

now , how we turn a chromosome out ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus , very simple is . it 's more complicated with bacteria to cope .
it 's much easier if you see it in <unk> how we 're doing , you just take the nucleus out and there 's another into it , and this is that 's exactly what they all this about clones have heard .
in <unk> is that chromosome into the cells integrated , but more recently we 've shown that you have a complete transplant a chromosome from one cell to the other aspects , and that activates can .
we have cleaned that chromosome one <unk> . a psychopath is said , these two to cut apart from how people , mice . we gave some <unk> up with us that chromosome , select their use . we <unk> it with what enzymes are about all these proteins to destroy . and it was very amazing when we put in a cell took off -- and they will our very <unk> graphics and here we estimate --
this new chromosome out went into the cell .
indeed we thought that 's the end is , but we tried the process of this is going to bring .
this is the <unk> the evolution , here .
we find all kinds of species here was a second chromosome we recorded their or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of the characteristics that in just a second to a species <unk> .
people , who became an evolutionary thinking as a gene that 's a moment changed that will have a lot of the biology , again .
there are enzymes are <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome , that in the cell was that 's not one ; the chromosomes are we added to have already .

it <unk> moving blue , because of the genes are we added up .
and after a very short time i did it all of characteristics of species , however , and converted it into a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell , given you have .
all the proteins and styles do the membranes , and styles do -- when we the genetic code , read , it was that 's exactly what we 're transferring have .
it may be like the genomic <unk> sound , but we 're able to make the <unk> to shift , things quite dramatic change .
so i 've argues that this is not the <unk> is -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i 've argues that we possibly greener on this is a new kind of the cambrian explosion to create in this massive new <unk> based on the digital media design may be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious on terms of what we need .
we 're starting from six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
about it into my relationship to ask : i went back in 1946 , born .
today are three people on planet for any of the back in 1946 , it 's ; within about 40 years will it four .
we have problems with food , with a fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel of 6.5 billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need more than five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that 's a hundred million barrels a day .
if we 're biological processes are thinking or any of the process to bring that replace , it 's a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's all the co2 from this material that in the atmosphere , lands .
we 've now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database about 20 million of genes , and i want to believe in fact that the <unk> the future are .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the variation in the came out .
we find here in primarily on the edges of biological reality and at the ones our imagination .
we 've now technologies , because of these rapid <unk> , in order to do this is what we <unk> genetics .
we 've now the possibility of a lot of robots to build the millions of chromosomes , the day , make anything .
if you imagine those 20 million of the various genes to produce or this process of tuning up to octane produce or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team over a molecular biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we 're able to the viability <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a piece of cartoon <unk> that we 're working on which you are actually sit and new species on the computer to design <unk>
you know , we do n't exactly how it looks down . we know exactly how their genetic code looks down .
we focus on here to switch fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn , making ethanol . he 's just a bad tv experiment is .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon the outcome , they get much higher <unk> have to be like octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only ways by biology is a big impact , no further in the number of the cost on food or the reduction of their availability of being is , if we added co2 as starting material can see , and so we 're working on cells are those away ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 is a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we 1996 , described to have .
he lives in the deep , about <unk> miles deep , at virtually boiling water <unk> .
it converts co2 in the methane coming down below the use of hydrogen , as a source .

within a short amount we think , we could actually be able to one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> ambitions as the biomaterial all the petrochemical industry . exactly what if you that 's not at ted i could do , where else ? there are projected the energy to be .
but as we 're currently in the same points for the development of vaccines to place .
you 've just this year with the flu , seen , we 're always a year , back off and have a dollar a little bit , if it around the right kind of vaccine ? is .
i think that changed that can be showing you <unk> vaccines , in <unk> created .
this is it , like the future , possibly could look at changes , can now the <unk> speeds are in synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are light years away people to improve . our goal is merely on us a chance to have long enough to survive by the possibility to do . thank you .
on the last ted conference room gave me an introduction to the lhc .
and i agreed back to come to them to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so far . and for all those who did n't there were , the lhc is the biggest increase science experiment , what i 've tackled that was -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is it , the conditions to create events which is less than an almost a second , after dawn of the universe already existed -- and i grew up to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just the breathtaking , ambitious .
this is the motor points below of geneva .
we 're taking pictures of these <unk> in the detectors on .
at that i work . he calls himself an atlas detector , out six meters in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here a spectacular picture of reference atlas off in the construction of them from the scale see .
on top of september the last year by running into the machine , the first place .
and this image taken by reference atlas .
it was making huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> what the entire process in order to the lhc <unk> , then we intentionally off with a part of the lhc <unk> to make the rain from the particles in the detector roaring out to leave .
in other words , when we this image on top of september they saw , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory is .
i do n't know whether this the biggest <unk> generated , or this , when someone the google being visited , and the front page , so i found .
it means that we have a cultural difference to the side of science , nothing else .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine thinking about these wired up to do had -- this golden wires wrapped up here .
those wires , guiding <unk> <unk> if the machine on <unk> involved .
now , the engineers , among you will you look and say , `` no that they do n't . that 's a little piano wires . ''
you can afford , because if you very far cooling , and they become something called <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , so , cooler than the space between the stars , you can deliver those wires in the tension in particular direction .
in one of the connections , between about <unk> magnet inside the lhc , there was an <unk> .
as heating up the wires , slightly and <unk> <unk> met and suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .

we were impaired , so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> them , <unk> you .
they 're now all back on their way back .
against the march , is the lhc along the <unk> be .
we 're going to him <unk> , and expecting the first data in june , or maybe july , `` system to do , and put our trip to continue to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , a way tapped by those accidents , again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> on such boundary . it 's easy , such thing to reject .
i think the fact that it 's how hard is , the fact that we about our barriers , beyond our grasp , is the value of things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my closing the words , an english scientist will let 's a humphrey davy , the one , i guess at the most useless experiments in his <unk> defended us to be a student came from michael <unk> , what i said , `` nothing is such dangerous for the evolution of human mind , when i assume that our scientific ideas for good is that it 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to conquer us . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
to write books , is my career , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my true , lifetime of love and fascination .
and i 'm not expect , in fact that ever change is .
but it 's recent something weird in my life and my career has happened to me that has bought , my reference to this work perfectly to revisit .
this curious incident was that i recently wrote a book -- did a biography of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that , essentially a different than all my previous book from some reasons in the world every expectation , and a big <unk> , international <unk> was .
the result is that i , anywhere i come to treat it 'll just as if i 'm beginning <unk> .
seriously -- the sinking <unk> !
for example , you come to be picked up to me and say , if you do n't make this success never went to be ?
they do n't worry about that they all their lives <unk> and never again a book is basically , that anybody in the world really care ? never again ? ''
okay , that 's really the courage .
it would be however , worse , when i don’t remember that would that i thought about 20 years , when i was a teenager i first of them told me to come a writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> response been faced my own .
people said , <unk> you 're not afraid , never worked out to have ?
you have n't afraid that you the humiliation of a notable letter to jump ?
you have n't afraid that you know from crafts and your life for <unk> and it 's not something that come and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are dying were going to -- your mouth is filled with the bitter ash of failure to get ?
i was about , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of all this thing .
and the i had always .
and i have a lot more things that fear that nobody <unk> would .
how the algae ... and other <unk> things .
but , if it 's hard to write about think i 've been through and i wonder : why ?
it 's reasonable that ?
it 's obvious that by somebody 's expected to be that he was scared of that has to the work to do to the he goes to invoke `` you feel ?
and what about the creative companies go to us into uncertainty about appreciation of apparition in business -- in a way it other professions are n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i ca n't solve any situation in his dream 40 years as a chemist , remember , where he was asked , if he feared would , chemist to be .
with your <unk> , john -- how about telling you ?
it did n't come back , you know ?
but about fair to be -- the group of the chemist , over the end to do n't the reputation of <unk> morph from people get .
we writer seem , but this kind of foie gras , to have not only the writer , but the huge dearth of genres , it looks like this call to have , mentally , huge occurs to be .
everything , they 're going to which is , at the bitter <unk> of really great minds from just the 20th century . watch , the young and a lot of my own hand , died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks from their talent , really being neglected .
norman <unk> said before he died in his last job interview , <unk> my books , i was a little more <unk>
an extraordinary point that you about your life can do .
but we shrug n't even if we get somebody something like to hear , because we all of these statements for so long story . somehow we have the notion that i 'd internalized , and collective , you accept that creativity and suffering , sort of stringing and that art -- the end -- i used to <unk> goes .
the question that i do today wish everyone here are places like this is : is this idea for you 're almost all right ?
it feels so i guess ? because with one inch to keep moving -- i feel with this perception actually ca n't think .

and i think it 's dangerous . and i do n't want to express now , as you go into the next century were adopted by step .
i think it better , if we did a huge dearth be socializing our lives .
and i know definitely , that it for me -- i was a situation -- very dangerous to be able to begin to this dark line straight in the presumption , sort <unk> -- especially in the situation where i 'm in my career as something that puts it .
this means -- look : i 'm very young . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i was probably another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely unlikely that everything , what i from now on writing , i 'm going from the world as the work being evaluated , the time <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it 's my straight , because we 're here right now all kind of friends -- it 's highly unlikely that my great success behind me lie .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
this is the kind of thoughts , the person to get to be able to 9 a.m . begin to <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i would prefer to continue this work to do that i love .
so it 's the question : how ?
after a while of <unk> seem to me that i got to continue to write to be able to a kind of <unk> psychological construct the brain needs .
somehow i have from now to find a way , when you write a safe distance to right between me and my very natural <unk> about how the response to the very well-written will be .
as i 'm in the last year after the models for looking up , in order to do this , i 've also in the past , looking for the and i 've tried to other societies , trying to see , you may be better or <unk> ideas about it did when we , how creativity can help , with the emotional and risk stuff , the about creativity are connected .
this quest that led me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please join me , because the bubble will come back to close .
but in ancient greece and rome , people have n't believe that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity of that 's divinely <unk> was , the from a remote , never heard of the source to the people coming -- for some mysterious , and unknown things .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates stated that is known that he 'd thought he had a <unk> , the him the wisdom of further away telling .
the romans had the same idea , we call this kind of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> .
this is great . the romans did n't really a genius , a very clever individual was .
they believed that 's a genius this kind of the magic divine , as somehow was that have thought was that it literally in the walls of a <unk> lives -- like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists to work with a sense of invisible <unk> and the result of work involves designing their dignity .
that 's brilliant -- there , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological construct a , which you out of the following your work to protect .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of <unk> was a certain things are protected , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant was <unk> you 're not all look for you deduct . everybody knew that you this <unk> genius had , that you have changed .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely off your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your moral genius did something <unk> .
so people a lot of the west really long time on creative thinking .
and then came the renaissance and everything looked . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let 's the individual into the center of the universe together -- all over the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , more for your unicorn creatures , the commands by the divine core of view .
it 's the dawn of rational idea of humanism , and people started to think creativity is completely off your own individual coming .
first time in the story , you can hear people that , or those with a genius , call -- instead of that it 's a genius did .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a sensation merely a person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like this pot , like this basin , and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , with unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psyche <unk> .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .

i think that <unk> our artists , the last 500 years only blew up .
and , if this is true , -- and i think it 's true -- is the question .
we can actually change ?
maybe the interventions , understanding about the relationship between humans and the mystery of creativity to return .
maybe not .
if we can that <unk> from 500 years rational idea of humanism , not just in a <unk> talk to eradicate poverty .
and there 's sure people in this audience who really memoir a science too hard to register to something about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people to follow and <unk> on their projects , etc . work .
i 'll probably not all of them on this journey to take them .
but the question that i letting you is : why not ?
why does n't think about this ?
because it makes very much sense like everything else that i 've heard , when it was , most absolutely crazy <unk> capriciousness and of creative process to explain .
a process , the way -- as everybody knows , the it ever has tried , something to do -- so in other words , like everyone here -- not always a bus is a situation .
in fact that he can be sometimes , literally <unk> feel .

she said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
the about this country on them <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the planet among their feet to <unk> us .
they knew that they 're in such a moment , just one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil population for the house while you about this poem that tracked was . it was only thing that she quickly enough to a paper and a pen to get to , so you , if it zip through them <unk> to catch up on the blank document i could .
in another painting was n't know how fast enough . they ran and hurried and ran , but they reached the house , not and the poem roll zip through them and you missed it . she said it would continue on land that , and -- how they said -- <unk> a different poet <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said , there are moments of where you let 's almost be missed .
so , she runs to the house and looking for the paper and the poem goes through them through and she reaches a pen , right when it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was so it 's like to the other hand and then we 've run , and it to put the wars .
you five miles the poem in his tail and moved it back into your body and it 's took on the paper .
in this opportunity came the poem and justly , and intact and on paper about -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i that sounded like i thought this is too scary -- that 's exactly how to my creative process <unk>
this is nothing like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to be able to me every day , the same time to stand and sweat , i struggle and pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i suppose that lots of them that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas which comes from a source from me <unk> that i do n't identify you can .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step with a relationship with no about our minds to lose , but for us in the opposite , even in mental health to hold ?
for me this is the first example , how do that i do n't worry about the musician and tom <unk> . i letting him a few years ago for a journal of the interview .
we talked about on this topic . and you know what ? most of time of his life was tom the embodiment of <unk> modern artist who was trying to these <unk> dearth of impulses that go back to live , to control and i 'm going to cope .

he drove up high speed as he suddenly a fragment of a melody and listens , the way of inspirations are often is , for him a miserably hard is tangible . and he wants you have . it 's gorgeous . he <unk> afterwards , but it can do n't grasp .
he has no paper , it has n't pen , it has n't recorders .
he starts so , those old <unk> for the rise , like . `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i’m coming from this song on forever to follow .
i 'm not enough , i create it up . ''
but rather than in to panic can run , he stopped work on .
he ended up all the line and doing something completely new .
he looked up in the sky , and saying <unk> , you ca n't see that i car driving ? ''
<unk> i like when i could just a song write it ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , when i show you care can .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> has been changed .
not the work itself . who was still many times as dark , jesus , and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , the him around , was salvaged when he 's genius from out into thinking , where he 's nothing more trouble , set and it 's going <unk> where he would say came from . he realized that 's not a skilled behavior , tormenting thing must be .
it was a rather unique being miraculous , bizarre about working with some kind of a conversation just sort of tom , and the alien , <unk> thing that 's not quite tom was .
when i do this story is it will have changed it also a bit of the way i worked and it got me before , salvaged .
this idea that saved me when i went out in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was . i fell into this dug of doubt in the we all fail , if we 're doing something to work and it does n't work . you <unk> back to think it 's a disaster is . this is the worst sketch artist book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but of the worst ever .
i started to think , i did this project , just <unk> .
but then i remember me of it , like tom in the free to heaven , talking had and i tried it .
i took so my view from the manuscript , and talked my blog commentary on its way an empty the corner of a room .
i spoke out loud , <unk> to , you thing , you and i know , both , if this book , not brilliant , this is that 's not entirely on my fault , is , right ?
because you see , yes , that i do everything , what i have to <unk> . i have no longer than that .
if you so much better have to , you 've got here show up and your contribution to deal procedure .
okay . but , if you do n't doing ... you know what , then the hell that .
i 'm still kept writing , because this is my job .
and i 'd go to record . give me to come today for my bit of jobs here , scraping
because -- the end it 's how to follow . centuries ago , who are in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the holy dances , and music spanning around , and hours -- ran into action -- the way to <unk> .
these strong were always been great , because the dancer who were a professional and they were fantastic .
but , and go back , very rare , was something special . one of the performers were actually is transcendent moments .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that they all in your life ever been such a performance , have seen .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a doorway to step . he did n't something different than it has ever did -- a thousand , nights earlier . but basically included in together .
and then suddenly appeared , he 's no longer just been brought human .
he was from the lights and from below is lighting and everything is lit up with a divine , fire .
as well , it 's then expanded , did people what it was . they called it at his name .
they put your hands together and began to sing : <unk> , allah , allah , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting history footnote : when the <unk> <unk> conquer they brought this practice on . the sounds , i looked over the end of <unk> , allah , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that is still in <unk> and <unk> heard .
if an education performers into spain , something and impossible , something magic have done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , allah , great , <unk> fantastic level , there you : a transient look at god .
and this is great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the following the next morning , if the dancer who wakes up and recognizes that it 's 11 o'clock at a tuesday -- is -- and he 's no longer a <unk> of god in itself is wearing .
he 's just an aging mortal with my aching kneel . and maybe he 'll never again to these heights of rising .
and perhaps will never again , somebody on earth 's point , when he could spin . but what is then it 's about the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is the <unk> corrections from a creative life .
but maybe it does not quite so full of the anguish , to be when you from the start n't believe that have that the extraordinary things about their existence of you could move .
if you might just think you a loaner are -- by a <unk> source for a <unk> time their life , which comes with somebody else i handed down , if you 've done it 's .
if we start , like to think about changing all this .
so i started to think and so i think about safety in the last month , while i think about the book working , that soon be going -- as the most dangerous , <unk> , for women judges waiting <unk> my <unk> success .
what i 'll keep itself should say , when i think about all going , is : did n't afraid .
not on , discourages people .
just do your job .
even to continue for your contribution here , whatever it may be .
if your job that dance is , dancing .
if this as being stupid divine genius , that you aside and put that is to decide , for a short time to a breath by miracles through your efforts to show , then <unk> ! ''
and if you could n't dancing in spite of your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all .
i think about and i feel that we should be teaching .
<unk> ! '' for you , despite all , just that you the mere human love and the <unk> now , it 's going to be .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides just showed up to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , the for nearly three million years of the size of the bottom forty-eight states had to 40 percent of killing me is .
but these pressing , not very strong enough , the seriousness , this particular problem of , because it 's not the thickness of ice is .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating our global climate system .
she grows in winter and contracting for the summer .
the next slide that i show that 's a <unk> what in the last 25 years , it 's happened .
this <unk> about red patient .
so you see , growing , it on the americas tagged species . this is the annual ice in the wintertime ; and it and contracting for the summer .
we called the <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood which is coming out of like , here <unk> .
in 25 years will it from here to here to be gone .
this is a problem , because the warming the frozen reason for the arctic sea <unk> , this large amounts of <unk> carbon exists , which , when he <unk> , of microbes out of methane to play this is .
comparing with the total amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , we could this amount back to double , if we have this critical moment that cross .
already today <unk> in some of shallow lakes in alaska , methane from ourselves from the water .
professor <unk> walter , the university in alaska 's with another task at another shallow seas in the last winter , across .
wow !
you 're doing good . the question is , how it gets us are subjected to .
and one reason is , this massive increase the exchangeable heat , warmed the greenland from the north .
this is a year <unk> .
but the volume , is substantially larger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know , like the sea through <unk> up here 's flowing out into the ocean .
those rivers so let 's rapidly to .

last month had signed the researchers that the entire continent now one negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , the about a couple <unk> show is really , particularly powerful in the melting .
it 's about 20 feet in sea , as in greenland .

forty percent of people in the world get half its <unk> , for that are draining snowmelt from .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
the <unk> have <unk> .
but if you <unk> , it also that most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in the <unk> the sierra seen .
this case of the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read people who are seriously .
this <unk> in the world -- the leading to a dramatically improve on fire .
and the catastrophe , around the world have a really <unk> and never done the same degree increased .
times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical terms of looking , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced these 24 hours -- 25 million tons daily in the oceans .
look at the realm of the eastern pacific , just on , the american continent the west and goes both of indian <unk> , where it was drastically decline of oxygen in the ocean there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent of life , is that burn off fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal , this is equal parts biggest problem .
the united states are one of those two largest <unk> , along with china .
and the suggestion was , many other <unk> to build .
but we start to a change to see .
here is the ones that in the last painted by , with some green alternatives , the world .
yet notwithstanding , there 's a political engagement in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to promote what to look what already a contradiction in itself is .
this reminded me of something .
for christmas , you are running , with me at home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> out .
they <unk> in the news that .
this is within all across the <unk> <unk> america .
this happened at christmas .
one of the advertisement of the spiraling out for christmas day was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it 's in the shell and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to expand .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .

this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the most powerful miners , is the director of massey coal .
let me a very clear to say . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry reed , they do n't know what they talk .
so it 's the alliance for <unk> two , campaign where we launched .
this is one , a part of her .
in the <unk> we see the climate change as a major threat to our business .
why we 've put us to self-assemble <unk> hey , a significant <unk> spend a down <unk> on the way to bring to the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is n't miserable .
we think it 's clean -- and it smells also good .
so , they do n't even worry about the climate .
assuming you this nice to us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about this .
so let 's a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the green <unk> .
and yet this burning of coal , one of the main reasons for the global warming is , most notable enough clean <unk> that you see changes everything .
look it just look at this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally , mash up the good alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's a climate crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , of these all connecting , is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like the dirty and coal and foreign oil .
but now there 's a courageous , new way to look out of this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america by 100 percent cleaner , electricity in new , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work to bring to us safer place to make up to help , the global warming , to stop .
finally , a solution that 's large enough , our to solve problems .
<unk> america in new . they get more glamorous out .
this is the last .
it 's a <unk> of america .

the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
now investment , for good well-paid jobs to create .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african proverb that , `` if you can be fast even wanting to go alone .
if you can come up wanting to go together . ''
we have far come , and it very quickly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask them , at the time your life <unk> , when you with <unk> playing .
while they did understand how to the hands , extending and <unk> , the <unk> input and moves , you learn in fact , to start thinking , and problems through the understanding and change <unk> the relations with solving .
the spatial can think is intimately that connect with , how we a lot of our environment to understand .

this question was so intense that we want to explore the answer decided , and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can use the driver 's being moved , you can each other species , you can move to capture , and they have a screen and a <unk> .

and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to sting of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> going and a conscious to move through design , each of see , and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we up with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll begin with some simply on .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , is the forward to run this ; if i put in the other direction <unk> , stepping it backwards .
and this interactive portraits should take each case .
if i do so close to leave , lights that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , notice it 's also , and make a little nervous .
and they feel anymore than their movements and slope .
quite a series of interactions are getting started , was that we keep everyday gestures on the data we use it could , like the colors , like to dump , how this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them to paint in the in the center to pour , where they then mixed use .
if we might overdo it , we can be a little <unk> .

i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers that i do with a simple <unk> led me .
this is playing with words , this kind of an amalgam of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically give each round up every <unk> random <unk> letters and while you 're trying to see words to form , are going on a dictionary codes .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back of mixed and you have a combination “st” and new ways to try .
thank you .
this is some kids are on a trip to the media lab is coming . and i could get you to move , giving it and i have a video of the place .
they really loved .
an interesting are capable of this kind of applications is that you people really not a lot of instructions , there must be .
whatever you need to say is `` you make our words , '' and you know exactly what to do is .
here are some people who actually test .
this is our youngest <unk> there , the bottom right .
it turns out that he 's the <unk> just a pile them wanted .

this is an interactive <unk> .

this is <unk> .
he can see new characters in the scene of bringing them , putting it 's the <unk> the picture pick up , of those figure shows .
so let 's the sun rise .
the sun goes on
now , lifting it 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah .
so he the <unk> shake and them side , puts it could , the characters and interact as well ...
-- his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , what they developed .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that today , i 've been , it to show that 's a <unk> for <unk> , that we recently have evolved and in the <unk> as a sound , how <unk> being basses and drum kit of imagery .
each has four different variations on ; you can choose which you wants to use .
and you can these sounds in the sequence of putting that you turn into any of pattern can arrange things .
and you dining you to make you just a <unk> at a <unk> happen .
there are the effects that you live , we can change , like . hall and filter .
you hook it with a particular sound , and the impulse control him go to hire .
and she got the overarching effects , like this pace , and the volume , are shown on the entire sequence that flies .
so let me .
we start , where we are <unk> in two <unk> putting and this in a row to mandate , they expand and a little bit of the voice or dates .
now putting me a bass , to know .
now , i get another thing were drums on , we do .
and just hook , i the filters at the drums , so i the effect of live control anything .
i can the entire sequence that speed , now by the rate in the or another way <unk> .
and just hook , i the filters were even with the bass -- for something more points .
i can the sequence happens when they 're headed to reorder .
so i have to do n't in the reservations are planning , but can truly improvising ; meanwhile , expand or to shrink .
and finally , i can the entire sequence <unk> , now by the <unk> to left we 're running .
thank you .
so as you can see , because my passion at new <unk> to develop , the better to the best fit , like our brains and bodies to work .
and today , i had time , you to a bunch of the new <unk> and some of the possibility of them , what we in our lab to work .
the idea that i 'm going to on the way to give you 'd like , is that we at the door to this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world 's just kind of our demands of communities .
thank you ,
i 'm pleased to the talks with you all !
